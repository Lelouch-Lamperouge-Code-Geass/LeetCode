Given a sorted array, two integers k and x, find the k closest elements to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

#### Note:

* The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
* Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10 ^ 4
* Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10 ^ 4

# Solution

The idea is to find the first number which is equal to or greater than ```x``` in ```arr```. Then, we determine the indices of the start and the end of a subarray in arr, where the subarray is our result. The time complexity is ```O(logn + k)```.

In the following code, ```arr[pos]``` is the first number which is euqal to or geater than ```x``` (if all numbers are less than ```x```, ```pos``` is arr.size()), and the result is ```arr(start, end]```.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findClosestElements(vector<int>& arr, int k, int x) {
        size_t pos = std::lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), x) - arr.begin();
        int start(pos - 1), end(pos);
        while (k-- > 0) {
            if (start < 0 
                || end < arr.size() && abs(arr[end] - x) < abs(arr[start] - x)) ++end;
            else --start;
        }
        return vector<int>(arr.begin() + start + 1, arr.begin() + end);
    }
};

```
