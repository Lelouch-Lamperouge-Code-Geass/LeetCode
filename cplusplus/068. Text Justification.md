Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

For example,

```
words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
L: 16.

Return the formatted lines as:

[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

__Note__ : Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.

__Corner Cases__:

* A line other than the last line might contain only one word. What should you do in this case?  
* In this case, that line should be left-justified.  

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        vector<string> res;
        for(int i(0), next_i(0); i < words.size(); i = next_i) {
            // Check how many words fit into the line.
            // We need to skip the space for last word hence start with line_len = -1.
            int line_len(-1);
            for(next_i = i; 
                next_i < words.size() 
                && line_len + words[next_i].size() + 1 <= maxWidth; 
                ++ next_i) {
                line_len += words[next_i].size() + 1;
            }
            
            // Calculate the number of extra spaces that can be equally distributed.
            // Also calculate number of extra spaces that need to be added to first few
            // words till we fill the line width.
            // For example line width is 20 we have three words of 3, 4, 2, 4 length
            // [our_,life_,is_,good_,_,_,_,_,] ==> [our_,_,_,life_,_,_is_,_,good].
            // Count number of empty spaces at end of line:= width - len = 20 - (15) = 5 
            // These five spaces need to be equally distributed between 4-1 = 3 gaps.
            // n words will have n-1 gaps between them.
            // 5 / 3 = 1 extra space between each word (in addition to default 1 space, 
            //                                          total space count = 2)
            // 5 % 3 = 2 extra spaces between first three words as shown above
            
            int evenlyDistributedSpaces = 1; 
            int extraSpaces = 0;
            int numOfGapsBwWords = next_i - i - 1; 
            
            if(next_i != i+1 && next_i != words.size()) {
                // Additional 1 for the default one space between words.
                evenlyDistributedSpaces = ((maxWidth - line_len) / numOfGapsBwWords) + 1;
                // Remaing extra spaces after evenly distribute spaces.
                extraSpaces = (maxWidth - line_len) % numOfGapsBwWords;
            }
            
            ostringstream oss;
            
            for(int j = i; j < next_i; ++j) {
                if (j != i) {
                    for(int s = 0; s < evenlyDistributedSpaces; ++s) {
                        oss << ' ';
                    }
                    if(extraSpaces > 0) {
                        oss << ' ';
                        --extraSpaces;
                    }
                }
                oss << words[j];
            }
            
            //Handle the above two cases we skipped, where there is only one word on line
            //or we reached end of word array. Last line should remain left aligned.
            string cur_line = oss.str();
            int remaining = maxWidth - cur_line.size();
            cur_line += std::string(remaining, ' ');
            res.emplace_back(cur_line);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

A different style. Might be more straightforward.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        vector<string> reval;
        for (int i = 0, next_i(i), n = words.size(); i < n; i = next_i) {
            next_i = i;
            int cur_len(-1);
            while (next_i < n && cur_len + 1 + words[next_i].size() <= maxWidth) {
                cur_len += 1 + words[next_i].size();
                ++ next_i;
            }
            
            ostringstream oss;
            if (i + 1 == next_i || next_i == words.size()) {
                // A single word in this line, or it is the last line of the text,
                // in this case, non extra spaces is inserted between words.
                for (int k = i; k < next_i; ++k) {
                    if (k > i) oss << ' ';
                    oss << words[k];
                }  
                oss << std::string(maxWidth - oss.str().size(), ' ');
            } else {
                int num_of_gap = next_i - i - 1;
                int num_of_evenly_space = 1 + (maxWidth - cur_len) / num_of_gap;
                int non_evenly_space = (maxWidth - cur_len) % num_of_gap;
                for (int k = i; k < next_i; ++k) {
                    if (k != i) { // Not the first word
                        oss << std::string(num_of_evenly_space, ' ');
                        if (non_evenly_space > 0) {
                            oss << ' ';
                            -- non_evenly_space;
                        }
                    }
                    oss << words[k];
                }    
            }
            reval.emplace_back(oss.str());
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
