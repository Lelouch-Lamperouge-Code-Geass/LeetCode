There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.

For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.

Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

If there isn't such day, output -1.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 
flowers: [1,3,2]
k: 1
Output: 2
Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: 
flowers: [1,2,3]
k: 1
Output: -1
```

#### Note:

* The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].

# Solution

### Solution one

This is a very intuitive solution. When one flower bloom, it make one original segment into two segments. All we need to do is to check whether these two new segments size is k.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kEmptySlots(vector<int>& flowers, int k) {
        size_t number_of_slots(flowers.size());
        vector<int> is_blooming(number_of_slots, false);
        
        int day(0);
        for (int flower_pos : flowers) {
            ++ day;
            -- flower_pos; // Adjust from 1-based index to 0-based index
            is_blooming[flower_pos] = true;
            if (day >= 2) {
                int left(flower_pos - 1), right(flower_pos + 1);
                while (left >= 0 && !is_blooming[left]) -- left;
                while (right < number_of_slots && !is_blooming[right]) ++ right;
                
                if (left >= 0) {
                    if (flower_pos - left - 1 == k) return day;
                }
                
                if (right < number_of_slots) {
                    if (right - flower_pos - 1 == k) return day;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Solution two

It seems that this question has some mistakes. I think there are two places that might lead to misunderstandings: (please feel free to tell me if I’m incorrect)

1. flowers[i] = x should mean that the unique flower that blooms at day i+1 (not i) will be at position x.
2. If you can get multiple possible results, then you need to return the minimum one.

The idea is to use an array ```days[]``` to record each position’s flower’s blooming day. That means ```days[i]``` is the blooming day of the flower in position i+1. We just need to find a subarray ```days[left, left+1,..., left+k-1, right]``` which satisfies: for any ````i = left+1,..., left+k-1```, we can have ```days[left] < days[i] && days[right] < days[i]```. Then, the result is ```max(days[left], days[right])```.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kEmptySlots(vector<int>& flowers, int k) {
        // Record the blooming day of each flower position.
        vector<int> blooming_day(flowers.size(), 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < flowers.size(); ++i) {
            blooming_day[flowers[i] - 1] = i + 1;
        }
        
        // Here (left, right) maintains a window, once all the values
        // within this window are smaller than blooming_day[left] and blooming_day[right],
        // we find a valid window. But we need to return the minimum day.
        int left = 0, right = k + 1, res = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0; right < blooming_day.size(); ++i){
            if(blooming_day[i] < blooming_day[left] || blooming_day[i] <= blooming_day[right]){   
                if(i == right) res = min(res, max(blooming_day[left], blooming_day[right]));    //we get a valid subarray
                left = i, right = k + 1 + i;
            }
        }
        return (res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res);
    }
};
```
