We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.

The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].

The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].

Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: A = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: A = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.
```

#### Note:

* A will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., A.length - 1].
* A will have length in range [1, 5000].
* The time limit for this problem has been reduced.

# Solution

My first intuitive solution is to use same methods as LeetCod-493-Reverse-Pairs, by using merge-sort or binary-indexed-tree or binary-search-tree to solve this problem.

However, after read the description again I found that the numbers' range is [0, N - 1], this means that we may have a simpler solution.

All local inversions are global inversions.

If the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions, it means that all global inversions in permutations are local inversions.
It also means that we can not find A[i] > A[j] with i+2<=j. In other words, max(A[i]) < A[i+2]

In this first solution, I traverse A and keep the current biggest number ```cur_max```. Then I check the condition ```cur_max < A[i+2]```.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& A) {
        if (A.size() <= 2) return true;
        int cur_max = A[0];
        for (int i = 2, n = A.size(); i < n; ++i) {
            cur_max = std::max(cur_max, A[i - 2]);
            if (cur_max > A[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

Basic on this idea, I tried to arrange an ideal permutation. Then I found that to place number i, I could only place i at A[i-1],A[i] or A[i+1]. The original order should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4â€¦], the number i should be on the position i. We just check the offset of each number, if the absolute value is larger than 1, means the number of global inversion must be bigger than local inversion, because a local inversion is a global inversion, but a global one may not be local.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int i = 0, n = A.size(); i < n; ++i) {
            if (std::abs(A[i] - i) > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
