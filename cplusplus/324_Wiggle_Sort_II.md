Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

Example:
(1) Given nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4], one possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6]. 
(2) Given nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1], one possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].

##### Note:
You may assume all input has valid answer.

##### Follow Up:
Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

# Solution
The intuitive solution to this problem is to split numbers into a smaller half and a bigger half.
And then get number from smaller array and bigger array alternatelyã€‚
How can we do better to get O(1) space complexity?
Then we have to perform the reconstruction in-place.
We know that we can use partition algorithm to make an array with half smaller and half bigger.
Here we can use three-way partitioning to arrange the numbers so that
those larger than the median come first, then those equal to the median come next,
and then those smaller than the median come last.
It is called three-way partition because original partition algorithm divide the array into bigger and smaller array, while three-way 
partition divides the array into bigger, equal, smaller array.
We just need to twist it a little bit to make numbers wiggle.
Make the partition results's indices [0, 1, 2, ... , n - 1, n] mapped to [1, 3, 5, ... , 0, 2, 4, ...].

Accessing A(0) actually accesses nums[1].

Accessing A(2) actually accesses nums[5].
Accessing A(3) actually accesses nums[7].
Accessing A(4) actually accesses nums[9].
Accessing A(5) actually accesses nums[0].
Accessing A(6) actually accesses nums[2].
Accessing A(7) actually accesses nums[4].
Accessing A(8) actually accesses nums[6].
Accessing A(9) actually accesses nums[8].

        // Note that it is not median, because it doesn't take average value when length is an even number.
        std::vector<int>::iterator pivot_pos = nums.begin() + nums_size / 2;
        std::nth_element(nums.begin(), pivot_pos, nums.end());

                // we can move mid forward here because we know all the number between [0, mid]
                // are not smaller than pivot
                std::swap(nums[getWiggleIndex(++left)], nums[getWiggleIndex(mid++)]);

                // can't ++mid here because we know nothing about nums[right]
                std::swap(nums[getWiggleIndex(mid)], nums[getWiggleIndex(--right)]); 
            } else { // == pivot
