You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
```

#### Note:

* The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]

# Solution

Note that here each subsequences __consist of__(it's not "contains") at least 3 consecutive integers. So every subsequence must be consecutive integers with minimum length of 3.

1. We iterate through the array once to get the frequency of all the elements in the array
2. We iterate through the array once more and for each element we either see if it can be appended to a previously constructed consecutive sequence or if it can be the start of a new consecutive sequence. If neither are true, then we return false.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> num_counter;
        for (int num : nums) ++num_counter[num];
        
        unordered_map<int, int> expecting_end_numbers;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num_counter[num] == 0) { // We have used current number.
                continue;
            } else {
                if (expecting_end_numbers[num] > 0) {
                    // If the current number can be added in the last consecutive sequence.
                    -- num_counter[num];
                    -- expecting_end_numbers[num];
                    ++ expecting_end_numbers[num + 1];
                } else if (num_counter[num + 1] > 0
                           && num_counter[num + 2] > 0) {
                    // Current number should form a consecutive sequence by itself 
                    // since it cannot be appended to a previous sequence.
                    -- num_counter[num];
                    -- num_counter[num + 1];
                    -- num_counter[num + 2];
                    ++ expecting_end_numbers[num + 3];
                } else {
                    // Doesn't belong to any consecutive sequence
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
