Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]

Output: 
"apple"
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]

Output: 
"a"
```

#### Note:

* All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters.
* The size of the dictionary won't exceed 1,000.
* The length of all the strings in the input won't exceed 1,000.

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLongestWord(string s, vector<string>& d) {
        std::string reval("");
        for (const std::string &word : d) {
            int word_index(0), word_size(word.size());
            for (int s_index = 0, s_size = s.size(); 
                 s_index < s_size && word_index < word_size;
                 ++ s_index) {
                if (s[s_index] == word[word_index]) {
                    ++ word_index;
                }
            }
            if (word_index == word_size) {  // word is a subsequence of s
                if (word_size > reval.size()
                   || word_size == reval.size() && word.compare(reval) < 0) {
                    // Update reval if a longer word, or a word with same length
                    // but is lexicographically smaller
                    reval = word;
                }
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
