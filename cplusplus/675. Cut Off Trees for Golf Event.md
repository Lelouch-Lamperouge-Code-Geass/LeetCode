You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:

* 0 represents the obstacle can't be reached.
* 1 represents the ground can be walked through.
* The place with number bigger than 1 represents a tree can be walked through, and this positive number represents the tree's height.

You are asked to cut off all the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height - always cut off the tree with lowest height first. And after cutting, the original place has the tree will become a grass (value 1).

You will start from the point (0, 0) and you should output the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.

You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,4],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: 6
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,0],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: -1
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: 
[
 [2,3,4],
 [0,0,5],
 [8,7,6]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree in (0,0) directly without walking.
```

# Solution

The solution has two steps:

1. Sort tree positions based on tree height; 
2. BFS to find shortest path between two points; 


There are a couple of things worth mentioning:

* The examples in the description show that the ```+1``` height tree is next to current tree. This is misleading. In fact, the tree with height 5 might be far way from the tree with height 6.   
* If there is no obstacles, the min-steps between two points are easy to get. It is just the sum of their row and column difference. Because of the obstacles, we need to use BFS/DFS to calculate the min-steps.  
* Note that it is guaranteed that no two trees have the same height. If trees with same height are acceptable, the problem become much harder. When we sort the trees based on height, for same height tree we need to put the closer tree before the further tree.
* It is possible that we can't reach from one tree to another because of the obstacles.
