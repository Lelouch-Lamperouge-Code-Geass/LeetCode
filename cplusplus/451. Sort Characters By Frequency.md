Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
  
#### Example 2:

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:

Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```  

# Solution

At first we count the frequench of each char and put them into a mapper.

Then we use a vector of string to assign each char to its bucket based on its frequency. It's obvious that the maximum frequency of a char won't be more than the size of the input string.

The space complexity is O(N), and time complexity is O(N) as well.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  string frequencySort(string s) {
    std::unordered_map<char, std::size_t> freq;

    for (char c : s) {
      ++ freq[c];
    }

    // The maximum frequence of char in s is s.size().
    // So we only need s.size() buckets.
    std::vector<std::string> buckets(s.size() + 1, "");
    for (const std::pair<char, size_t> & item : freq) {
      buckets[item.second].append(item.second, item.first);
    }

    std::string reval("");
    for (std::size_t s_size = s.size(), i = s_size; i <= s_size; --i) {
      if (!buckets[i].empty()) {
        reval.append(buckets[i]);
      }
    }

    return reval;
  }
};
```
