Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

#### Example:

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

#### Restrictions:

* The string consists of lower English letters only.
* Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        for (int i = 0, n = s.size(); i < n; i += 2 * k) {
            for(int left = i, right = std::min(i + k - 1, n - 1); 
                left < right; 
                ++ left, -- right) {
                std::swap(s[left], s[right]);
            }
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
