A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note:

1. A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
2. Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.

Example 1:

```
Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

# Solution

With all the given transactions, in the end, each person with ID = id will have an overall balance bal[id]. Note that the id value or any person coincidentally with 0 balance is irrelevant to debt settling count, so we can simply use an array debt[] to store all non-zero balances, where

* debt[i] > 0 means a person needs to pay $ debt[i] to other person(s);
* debt[i] < 0 means a person needs to collect $ debt[i] back from other person(s).

Starting from first debt debt[0], we look for all other debts debt[i] (i>0) which have opposite sign to debt[0]. Then each such debt[i] can make one transaction debt[i] += debt[0] to clear the person with debt debt[0]. From now on, the person with debt debt[0] is dropped out of the problem and we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.

Note: Thanks to @KircheisHe who found the following great paper about the debt settling problem:

[Settling Multiple Debts Efficiently: An Invitation to Computing Science by T. Verhoeff, June 2003.](http://www.mathmeth.com/tom/files/settling-debts.pdf)

The question can be transferred to a [3-partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-partition_problem) problem, which is NP-Complete.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTransfers(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<int, long> balance;
        for (const vector<int> &tran : transactions) {
            balance[tran[0]] -= tran[2];
            balance[tran[1]] += tran[2];
        }
        
        vector<long> debt; 
        for (const pair<int,int> &balan : balance) {
            if (balan.second != 0) {
                debt.emplace_back(balan.second);
            }
        }
        
        return dfs(debt, 0, 0);
    }
private:
    // Return minimal number of transactions to settle starting from debt[start]
    int dfs(vector<long> &debt,
            std::size_t start,
            int count) {
        while (start < debt.size() && !debt[start]) {
            ++ start; // get next non-zero debt
        }
    	int reval(INT_MAX);
        long prev(0);
    	for (std::size_t i = start + 1; i < debt.size(); ++i) {
    	  if (debt[i] != prev && debt[i] * debt[start] < 0) {// skip already tested or same sign debt
    	    debt[i] += debt[start]; 
            reval = min(reval, dfs(debt, start + 1, count + 1)); 
            debt[i] -= debt[start];
            prev =  debt[i];
          }
        }
    	return reval < INT_MAX? reval : count;
    }
};
```
