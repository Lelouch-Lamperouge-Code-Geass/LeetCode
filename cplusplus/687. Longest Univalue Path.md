Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:

              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
Output:

2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:

              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
Output:

2
```

__Note:__ The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.

# Solution

### Solution one

Here we use an intuitive way: instead of calculating the path, we calculate the number of nodes on the longest univalue path. And our final result is this number minus one.

We call function ```getNodesNumberOnLupToChild``` on each node. In this function we calculate the number of nodes on the longest univalue path to its child, if the child has the same value as current node, that means we can concatenate this child's path to current node. This function's return value is the number of nodes on the longest univalue path from this node to its children. And on this node, we also need to calculate the nodes amount of longeset univalue path __including__ current node, which can be calculated by concatenating current node to its left and right children's longest univalue path.

One mistake I often made is, sometimes I check whether a node's child has the same value as this node and decide whether to ```getNodesNumberOnLupToChild``` on that child. This is WRONG. Remember, we need to checking ```max_count``` on each node, that is to say, __we need to call ```getNodesNumberOnLupToChild``` on every node no matter what.__

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int getNodesNumberOnLupToChild(TreeNode* root, int &max_count) {
        int reval(0);
        if (root) {
            reval = 1;
            
            // Note that we need to call this function for children no matter what.
            // Because we are updating max_count on each node.
            int left_count = getNodesNumberOnLupToChild(root->left, max_count); 
            int right_count = getNodesNumberOnLupToChild(root->right, max_count);
            
            if (root->left && root->left->val != root->val) {
                left_count = 0;
            }
            
            if (root->right && root->right->val != root->val) {
                right_count = 0;
            }
              
            max_count = std::max(max_count, left_count + 1 + right_count);
            reval = 1 + std::max(left_count, right_count);
        }
        return reval;
    }
    
public:
    int longestUnivaluePath(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int number_of_nodes_on_lup(0);
        getNodesNumberOnLupToChild(root, number_of_nodes_on_lup);
        return number_of_nodes_on_lup - 1;
    }
};
```

### Solution two

Same as above, but here we calculate the length instead of number of nodes, which make this solution more straightforward.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int getLengthOfLongestUnivaluePathToChild(TreeNode* node, int &max_len) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int left_len = getLengthOfLongestUnivaluePathToChild(node->left, max_len); 
        int right_len = getLengthOfLongestUnivaluePathToChild(node->right, max_len);
        int resl = node->left && node->left->val == node->val ? left_len + 1 : 0;
        int resr = node->right && node->right->val == node->val ? right_len + 1 : 0;
        max_len = max(max_len, resl + resr);
        return max(resl, resr);
    }
    
public:
    int longestUnivaluePath(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int max_len(0);
        getLengthOfLongestUnivaluePathToChild(root, max_len);
        return max_len;
    }
};
```
