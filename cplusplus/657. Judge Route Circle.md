Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to __the original place__.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are ```R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down)```. The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int x_pos(0), y_pos(0);
        
        for (char c : moves) {
            switch(c) {
                case 'U' : --y_pos; break;
                case 'D' : ++y_pos; break;
                case 'L' : --x_pos; break;
                case 'R' : ++x_pos; break;
                default : break;
            }
        }
        
        return x_pos == 0 && y_pos == 0;
    }
};
```
