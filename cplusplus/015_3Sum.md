Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
```
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```
  
# Solution

The bruteforce solution is to exhaust all the possibilities, calculate the sum of all triplets and check whether the sum is smaller than target. The time complexity is O(N^3).

How can we do better?

Since the input array is "rambled", means it has no internal pattern that we can use to improve our algorithm, there are in general two methods we can do:

1. Use auxiliary data structure to help us, e.g. HashTable. Basically we will do a __space-time tradeoff__ (A space-time or time-memory tradeoff in computer science is a case where an algorithm or program trades increased space usage with decreased time).
2. Sort the input array and use the "sorted" pattern. 

Here we will go with the second option.

We sort the array first. Then, for each element, we use the two pointer approach to find the number of triplets that meet the requirements.

Sorting array takes O(NlogN), will our for loop with two pointers takes O(N^2).

__Time complexity : O(n^2)__

__Note: you need take care of duplicates carefully.__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        vector<vector<int>> reval;
        
        for (std::size_t i = 0, n = nums.size(); i + 2 < n; ++i) {
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue; // duplicate
            std::size_t low(i + 1), high (n - 1);
            while (low < high) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[low] + nums[high];
                const int cur_low(nums[low]), cur_high(nums[high]);
                if (0 == sum) {
                    vector<int> item = {nums[i], nums[low], nums[high]};
                    reval.emplace_back(item);
                    // avoid duplicate
                    while (low < high && nums[low] == cur_low) ++low;
                    while (low < high && nums[high] == cur_high) --high;
                } else if (0 > sum) {
                    // we know that we won't find an answer for cur_low
                    while (low < high && nums[low] == cur_low) ++low; 
                } else {
                    // we know that we won't find an answer for cur_high
                    while (low < high && nums[high] == cur_high) --high;
                }
            }
            
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
};
