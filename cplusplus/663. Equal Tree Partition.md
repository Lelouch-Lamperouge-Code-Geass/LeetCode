Given a binary tree with n nodes, your task is to check if it's possible to partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values after removing exactly one edge on the original tree.

##### Example 1:

```
Input:     
    5
   / \
  10 10
    /  \
   2   3

Output: True
Explanation: 
    5
   / 
  10
      
Sum: 15

   10
  /  \
 2    3

Sum: 15
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input:     
    1
   / \
  2  10
    /  \
   2   20

Output: False
Explanation: You can't split the tree into two trees with equal sum 
    after removing exactly one edge on the tree.
```

#### Note:

* The range of tree node value is in the range of [-100000, 100000].
* 1 <= n <= 10000

# Solution

In order to partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values after removing exactly one edge on the original tree, we need to find a substree whose sum is the half value of the sum of the whole original tree. This also means that the total sum of the whole tree can only be even number.

The idea is to use a hash table to record all the different sums of each subtree in the tree. If the total sum of the tree is sum, we just need to check if the hash table constains sum/2.

A special case is when ```total_sum == 0```. Let's see why it is special. For other even sum values which is not 0(odd sum will return false immediately), ```sum / 2 != sum``` which means that as long as we confirm that there is a sum value of a substree exists, then it is possible to partition the tree as required. However, when ```total_sum == 0```, ```sum / 2 == sum```, therefore, the sum with root node is definitely 0, and we need to find another node whose sum value is 0. This means that we need to make sure at least two nodes(including root node, could be more nodes since tree node value can be negative) has sum value 0.

```
Some special examples:

[0,-1,1]
```

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int getSum(TreeNode* root, 
               unordered_map<int, int> &sum_counter) {
        int reval(0);
        
        if (root) {
            reval = root->val + getSum(root->left, sum_counter)
                    + getSum(root->right, sum_counter);
            ++ sum_counter[reval];
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
public:
    bool checkEqualTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Count the sum of each subtree. 
        unordered_map<int, int> sum_counter;
        
        int total_sum = getSum(root, sum_counter);
        
        if (total_sum == 0) {
            // A special case when total_sum is 0.
            // It is possible that only the sum at root node
            // is 0. Therefore, we need to make sure another node
            // in this tree whose sum is also 0.
            return sum_counter[total_sum] >= 2;
        }
        
        return total_sum % 2 == 0    // Must be even number
               && sum_counter.count(total_sum / 2); // subtree sum exists.
    }
};
```
