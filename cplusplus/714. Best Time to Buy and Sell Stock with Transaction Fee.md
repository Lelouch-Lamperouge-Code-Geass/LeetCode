Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

##### Note:

* 0 < prices.length <= 50000.
* 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
* 0 <= fee < 50000.

# Solution

If we know the max profit on each index, then we know the max profit of the whole array.
The max profit on each index is depend on the max profit of buy one stock that day, and the max profit of sell one stock that day.

On each day, we can take three actions : buy, sell, rest. But we must sell the stock before buy again.

* Let max_profit_end_with_buy[i] be the maximum profit that could be gained at the end of the i-th day with last action is BUY, note here that the last action is BUY and it can happen on any days before i-th day.  
* Let max_profit_end_with_sell[i] be the maximum profit that could be gained at the end of the i-th day with last action is SELL, note here that the last action is SELL and it can happen on any days before i-th day.  

(If we define max_profit_end_with_buy[i] and max_profit_end_with_sell[i] as the action on i-th day is BUY/SELL, then we will find it is hard to derive their value from sub-problems. In this case, max_profit_end_with_sell[i] is depeneded on max_profit_end_with_buy[0 ~ i-1].)

Now we have

```
max_profit_end_with_buy[i] = std::max(max_profit_end_with_buy[i - 1], 
                                      max_profit_end_with_sell[i - 1] - prices[i] - fee);
max_profit_end_with_sell[i] = std::max(max_profit_end_with_sell[i - 1], 
                                      max_profit_end_with_buy[i - 1] + prices[i]);
```

You can get a detailed explanation from a slightly different perspective by somebody else : https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/discuss/108870/.

Now the tricky part becomes what should be the initial value for ```buy[0]``` and ```sell[0]```? On day 0, if buy and sell one stock here, we will end up with being charged with transaction fee, so ```sell[0]``` should be 0 here which means that we don't do any transaction. ```buy[0]``` should be ```-prices[0] - fee``` or ```-prices[0]``` depends on whether you want to charge transaction fee when buy a stock or sell a stock. It won't affect the problem result here.

__Time complexity is O(N), space complexity is O(N).__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        const int n(prices.size());
        vector<int> max_profit_end_with_buy(n, INT_MIN);
        vector<int> max_profit_end_with_sell(n, 0);
        
        max_profit_end_with_buy[0] = -prices[0] - fee; 
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            max_profit_end_with_buy[i] = std::max(max_profit_end_with_buy[i - 1], 
                                                  max_profit_end_with_sell[i - 1] - prices[i] - fee);
            max_profit_end_with_sell[i] = std::max(max_profit_end_with_sell[i - 1], 
                                                  max_profit_end_with_buy[i - 1] + prices[i]);
        }
        
        return max_profit_end_with_sell.back();
    }
};
```

Of course, we can optimize the space complexity here.

__Time complexity is O(N), space complexity is O(1).__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {      
        int end_with_buy = -prices[0] - fee, end_with_sell = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            end_with_buy = std::max(end_with_buy, end_with_sell - price - fee);
            end_with_sell= std::max(end_with_sell, end_with_buy + price);
        }
        
        return end_with_sell;
    }
};
```
