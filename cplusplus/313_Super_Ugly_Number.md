Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k. For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.

Note:
(1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
(2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
(3) 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
(4) The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

# Solution

 The keypoint here is that new prime number is generated by multiplying a prime with previous generated ugly number. 
  
### Solutione one

  __Time complexity ： O(n * number of primes)__
  
  
```cpp  
class Solution {
public:
  int nthSuperUglyNumber(int n, vector<int>& primes) {
    int primes_size(primes.size());
    vector<int> index(primes_size,0), ugly(n,INT_MAX);
    ugly[0] = 1;
    for (int i=1;i<n;++i) {
      for (int j=0;j<primes_size;++j) ugly[i] = std::min(ugly[i],primes[j]*ugly[index[j]]);
      for (int j=0;j<primes_size;++j) index[j]+=(ugly[i]==ugly[index[j]]*primes[j]? 1 : 0);
    }
    return ugly[n-1];
  }
};
```
