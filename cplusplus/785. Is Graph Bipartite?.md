Given an undirected ```graph```, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: ```graph[i]``` is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: ```graph[i]``` does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

```
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
``` 

#### Note:

* graph will have length in range [1, 100].
* graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
* graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
* The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

# Solution

Our goal is trying to use two colors to color the graph and see if there are any adjacent nodes having the same color.
Initialize a color[] array for each node. 

Here we use ```enum``` type to represent the colors.

```{EMPTY, BLACK, WHITE}```

For each node:

* If it hasnâ€™t been colored, use a color to color it. Then use another color to color all its adjacent nodes (DFS).
* If it has been colored, check if the current color is the same as the color that is going to be used to color it. 

### Attention

#### Note that the graph is NOT necessary connected!

Example :

```
[[1], [0], [3], [2]]
```

Or 

```
[[],[2,4,6],[1,4,8,9],[7,8],[1,2,8,9],[6,9],[1,5,7,8,9],[3,6,9],[2,3,4,6,9],[2,4,5,6,7,8]]
```

#### Self-point node

A node can have a edge pointing to itself, of course in this case return value will be false.

```
[[0], [1]]
```

### Solution with DFS

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    enum Color {
        EMPTY, BLACK, WHITE
    };
    Color toggleColor(Color color) {
        if (color == BLACK) return WHITE;
        else if (color == WHITE) return BLACK;
        else return EMPTY;
    }
    bool tryFillColor(const vector<vector<int>>& graph,
                      vector<Color> &colors_of_nodes,
                      int node_id,
                      Color fill_color) {
        if (colors_of_nodes[node_id] != EMPTY) {
            // Node has been painted, just need to make sure
            // it is the color we want.
            // This also means that the node has been visited.
            return colors_of_nodes[node_id] == fill_color;
        } else {
            colors_of_nodes[node_id] = fill_color;
            for (int neighbor : graph[node_id]) {
                if (!tryFillColor(graph, colors_of_nodes, neighbor, toggleColor(fill_color))) {
                    return false;
                }    
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        const size_t number_of_nodes(graph.size());
        vector<Color> colors_of_nodes(number_of_nodes, EMPTY);
        for (int node_id = 0; node_id < number_of_nodes; ++node_id) {
            if (colors_of_nodes[node_id] == EMPTY) {
                // For node that has not been painted, we paint it to WHITE.
                // Of course, you can choose BLACK as well, just a preference.
                if(!tryFillColor(graph, colors_of_nodes, node_id, WHITE)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Solution with BFS

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    enum Color {EMPTY, WHITE, BLACK};
    Color toggleColor(Color color) {
        if (color == BLACK) return WHITE;
        else if (color == WHITE) return BLACK;
        else return EMPTY;
    }
    bool tryFillColor(const vector<vector<int>>& graph,
                      vector<Color> &color_of_nodes,
                      int node_id,
                      Color fill_color) {
        queue<int> nodes;
        color_of_nodes[node_id] = fill_color;
        nodes.push(node_id);

        while (!nodes.empty()) {
            int cur_node = nodes.front();
            nodes.pop();

            for (int neighbor : graph[cur_node]) {
                if (color_of_nodes[neighbor] != EMPTY) {
                    if (color_of_nodes[neighbor] == color_of_nodes[cur_node]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                } else {
                   color_of_nodes[neighbor] = toggleColor(color_of_nodes[cur_node]);
                   nodes.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        const size_t number_of_nodes(graph.size());
        vector<Color> colors_of_nodes(number_of_nodes, EMPTY);
        for (int node_id = 0; node_id < number_of_nodes; ++node_id) {
            if (colors_of_nodes[node_id] == EMPTY) {
                // For node that has not been painted, we paint it to WHITE.
                // Of course, you can choose BLACK as well, just a preference.
                if(!tryFillColor(graph, colors_of_nodes, node_id, WHITE)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
