Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

#### Example :

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between 
node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

#### Note:

* The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
* The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int minDiffInBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int min_diff(INT_MAX);
        
        stack<TreeNode*> nodes;
        TreeNode *pre(nullptr);
        while (root || !nodes.empty()) {
            if (root) {
                nodes.push(root);
                root = root->left;
            } else {
                root = nodes.top();
                nodes.pop();
                if (pre) {
                    min_diff = std::min(min_diff, root->val - pre->val);
                }
                pre = root;
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        
        return min_diff;
    }
};
```
