In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.

If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
```
 

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
```
 

#### Note:

* ```nums``` will have a length in the range ```[1, 50]```.
* Every ```nums[i]``` will be an integer in the range ```[0, 99]```.

# Solution

In this problem  nums[i]'s range is [0, 99]. If nums[i] can be negative then the description will need to have more clarification. For example, -1 is larger than -2, but -1 is not twice than -2 nor can we say that -2 is a larger number twice than -1.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dominantIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        // We know that nums[i]'s range is [0, 99] 
        int max1 = 0, max2 = 0, idxOfMax1 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] > max1) {
                max2 = max1;
                max1 = nums[i];
                idxOfMax1 = i;
            } else if (nums[i] > max2) {
                max2 = nums[i];
            }
        }        
        return max1 >= max2 * 2 ? idxOfMax1 : -1;
    }
};
```
