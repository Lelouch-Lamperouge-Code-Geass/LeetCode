Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

##### Example:

```         
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
```


Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.

##### Follow up:

* What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
* How does it change the problem?
* What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

# Solution         

First of all, the title here is quite inappropriate. 

You need to understand the __difference between combination and permutation__.


         
### A TLE solution
         
```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    void generateCombinationWithBacktracking(const vector<int> &nums,
                                             const int target,
                                             const int cur_sum,
                                             int &count) {
        if (cur_sum == target) ++ count;
        if (cur_sum > target) return;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (cur_sum + nums[i] > target) break;
            generateCombinationWithBacktracking(nums, target, cur_sum + nums[i], count);
        }
    }
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int count(0);
        generateCombinationWithBacktracking(nums, target, 0, count);
        return count;
    }
};
```
  
### A better solution  

Think about the recurrence relation first. How does the # of combinations of the target related to the # of combinations of numbers that are smaller than the target?

So we know that target is the sum of numbers in the array. Imagine we only need one more number to reach target, this number can be any one in the array, right? So the # of combinations of target, comb[target] = sum(comb[target - nums[i]]), where 0 <= i < nums.length, and target >= nums[i].

In the example given, we can actually find the # of combinations of 4 with the # of combinations of 3(4 - 1), 2(4- 2) and 1(4 - 3). As a result, comb[4] = comb[4-1] + comb[4-2] + comb[4-3] = comb[3] + comb[2] + comb[1].

Then think about the base case. Since if the target is 0, there is only one way to get zero, which is using 0, we can set comb[0] = 1.

EDIT: The problem says that target is a positive integer that makes me feel itâ€™s unclear to put it in the above way. Since target == 0 only happens when in the previous call, target = nums[i], we know that this is the only combination in this case, so we return 1.

Now we can come up with at least a recursive solution.
         
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if (target == 0) return 1;
        int reval(0);
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (target >= num) {
                reval += combinationSum4(nums, target - num);
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```

Now for a DP solution, we just need to figure out a way to store the intermediate results, to avoid the same combination sum being calculated many times. We can use an array to save those results, and check if there is already a result before calculation. 

#### A top-down DP solution

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int helper(const vector<int>& nums,
               const int target,
               vector<int> &number_of_combination) {
        if (number_of_combination[target] != -1) {
            return number_of_combination[target];
        } else {
           int count(0);
           for (int num : nums) {
                if (target >= num) {
                    count += helper(nums, target - num, number_of_combination);
                }
            }
            number_of_combination[target] = count;
            return count;
        }
    }
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> number_of_combination(target + 1, -1);
        number_of_combination[0] = 1;
        return helper(nums, target, number_of_combination);
    }
};
```

#### A bottom-up DP solution

Note here 

```
number_of_combination[number] += number_of_combination[number - num];
```

is not 

```
number_of_combination[number] += number_of_combination[number - num] * number_of_combination[num];
```

the latter will result duplicates.

         
```cpp         
class Solution {
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> number_of_combination(target + 1, 0);
        number_of_combination[0] = 1;
        for (int number = 1; number <= target; ++number) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (number >= num) {
                    number_of_combination[number] += number_of_combination[number - num];
                }
            }
        }
        return number_of_combination[target];
    }
};
```


### About follow-up

The problem with negative numbers is that now the combinations could be potentially of infinite length. Think about nums = [-1, 1] and target = 1. We can have all sequences of arbitrary length that follow the patterns -1, 1, -1, 1, ..., -1, 1, 1 and 1, -1, 1, -1, ..., 1, -1, 1 (there are also others, of course, just to give an example). So we should limit the length of the combination sequence, so as to give a bound to the problem.
