Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. 
If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. 
No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), 
so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

#### Note:

* 1 <= length of the array <= 20.
* Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
* If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

# Solution

### Solution one

The dp[i][j] saves how much __more__ scores that the __first-in-action player__(not necessarily player A) will get from i to j than the second player. __First-in-action means whomever moves first.__ You can still make the code even shorter but I think it looks clean in this way.


After we decide that dp[i][j] saves how much more scores that the first-in-action player will get from i to j than the second player, the next step is how we update the dp table from one state to the next. Going back to the question, each player can pick one number either from the left or the right end of the array. Suppose they are picking up numbers from position i to j in the array and it is player Aâ€™s turn to pick the number now. If player A picks position i, player A will earn nums[i] score instantly. Then player B will choose from i + 1 to j. __Please note that dp[i + 1][j] already saves how much more score that the first-in-action player will get from i + 1 to j than the second player. So it means that player B will eventually earn dp[i + 1][j] more score from i + 1 to j than player A. So if player A picks position i, eventually player A will get nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j] more score than player B after they pick up all numbers.__ Similarly, if player A picks position j, player A will earn nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1] more score than player B after they pick up all numbers. Since A is smart, A will always choose the max in those two options, so:
dp[i][j] = Math.max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        if ((n & 1) == 0) return true; 
        
        vector<vector<int>> more_scores(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int i = j; i >= 0; --i) {
                if (i == j) {
                    more_scores[i][j] = nums[i];
                } else {
                    more_scores[i][j] = std::max(nums[i] - more_scores[i + 1][j],
                                                nums[j] - more_scores[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return more_scores[0][n - 1] >= 0;
    }
};
```

### Solution two

The goal is maximize the sum of first player.

We have a numeric array from 0 ~ n, i and j is the index. dp[i][j] means the max sum we can get if the array starts from i and ends to j.

So dp[i][i] means only one coin and we pick firstly, dp[i][i+1] means there are two coins, we pick the larger one.

To maximum our gain, ```dp[i][j] = max( nums[i] + dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1] + nums[j])```, since we either will pick the i or j coin. __But here dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1] are not the values directly available for us, it depends on the move that our opponent make.__

Then we assume our opponent is as good as we are and always makes optimize move. The worse case is that we will get the minimal value out of all possible situation after our opponent makes its move.

So the correct dp formula would be

```
dp[i][j] = max( min (dp[i + 1][j - 1], dp[i + 2][ j]) + v[i], 
                min (dp[i][j - 2], dp[i + 1][ j - 1]) + v[j]})
```

* If we pick i, then our opponent need to deal with subproblem dp[i + 1][j], it either picks from i + 2 or j - 1. Similarly, * If we pick j, then our opponent need to deal with subproblem dp[i][j - 1] , it either pick from i + 1 or j - 2. We take the worse case into consideration so use min() here.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        if ((n & 1) == 0) return true; 
        
        vector<vector<int>> max_sum(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int i = j; i >= 0; --i) {
                if (i == j) {
                    max_sum[i][j] = nums[i];
                } else {
                    // When we choose nums[i], our opponent can choose at the same end, 
                    // which gave him nums[i + 1], and leave us max_sum[i + 2][ j]
                    int a = (i + 2 < n) ? max_sum[i + 2][ j] : 0;
                    
                    // When we choose nums[j], our opponent can choose 
                    // at the same end, which gave him nums[j - 1], 
                    // and leave us max_sum[i][ j - 2]
		            int b = (j - 2 >= 0) ? max_sum[i][j - 2] : 0;
                    
                    // In above two cases, our opponent can choose the opposite end
                    // which leaves us max_sum[i + 1][j - 1]
                    int c = (i + 1 < n && j - 1 >= 0) ? max_sum[i + 1][j - 1] : 0;
                             
                    max_sum[i][j] = std::max(std::min(a, c) + nums[i],
                                             std::min(b, c) + nums[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        int sum = max_sum[0][n - 1];
        return sum * 2 >= std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    }
};
```
