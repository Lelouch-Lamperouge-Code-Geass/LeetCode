Reverse a singly linked list.

Hint:  
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?  

# Solution

### Solution 1 

Iterative solution.

Note here we did not make dummy.next = head at first. In this way, we can easily make sure that the next pointer of the final node will be nullptr.

And this code can handle empty list pretty good too.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode dummy(0), *next(nullptr);
        while (head) {
            next = head->next;
            head->next = dummy.next;
            dummy.next = head;
            
            head = next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

### Solution 2

Recursive solution.

The basic idea of this recursive solution is to reverse all the following nodes after head. Then we need to set head to be the final node in the reversed list. We simply set its next node in the original list (head -> next) to point to it and sets its next to be NULL.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head||!head->next) return head;
        ListNode* node(reverseList(head->next));
        head->next->next = head;
        head->next = nullptr;
        return node;
    }
};
```
