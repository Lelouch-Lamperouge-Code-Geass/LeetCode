In a 2D grid from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1), every cell contains a 1, except those cells in the given list mines which are 0. What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1s contained in the grid? Return the order of the plus sign. If there is none, return 0.

An "axis-aligned plus sign of 1s of order k" has some center grid[x][y] = 1 along with 4 arms of length k-1 going up, down, left, and right, and made of 1s. This is demonstrated in the diagrams below. Note that there could be 0s or 1s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1s.

##### Examples of Axis-Aligned Plus Signs of Order k:

```
Order 1:
000
010
000

Order 2:
00000
00100
01110
00100
00000

Order 3:
0000000
0001000
0001000
0111110
0001000
0001000
0000000
```

##### Example 1:

```
Input: N = 5, mines = [[4, 2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
11111
11111
11111
11111
11011
In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be order 2.  One of them is marked in bold.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: N = 2, mines = []
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is no plus sign of order 2, but there is of order 1.
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: N = 1, mines = [[0, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There is no plus sign, so return 0.
```

##### Note:

* N will be an integer in the range [1, 500].
* mines will have length at most 5000.
* mines[i] will be length 2 and consist of integers in the range [0, N-1].
* (Additionally, programs submitted in C, C++, or C# will be judged with a slightly smaller time limit.)

### Solution one, brute-force, 498 ms

This solution works and it is very straightforward, but it is very slow.

The worst case happens when ```mines``` is empty, that means the whole grid only has 1.

The ```tryExpand``` function will traverse ```N/2``` times.

The time complexity is O(N^3).

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int tryExpand(vector<vector<int>> &grid, int row, int col) {
        int len(0);
        const int row_size = grid.size(), col_size = grid[0].size();
        for (int up = row, down = row, left = col, right = col;
             up >= 0 && down < row_size && left >= 0 && right < col_size 
             && grid[up][col] == 1 && grid[down][col] == 1
             && grid[row][left] == 1 && grid[row][right] == 1;
             -- up, ++ down, -- left, ++ right) {
            ++ len;
        }
        return len;
    }
public:
    int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int N, vector<vector<int>>& mines) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(N, vector<int>(N, 1));
        
        for (vector<int> &mine : mines) {
            grid[mine[0]][mine[1]] = 0;
        }
        
        int reval(0);
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int len = tryExpand(grid, i, j);
                    reval = std::max(reval, len);
                }
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```

Created 4 matrices for storing largest streak of ones on left, right top and bottom. Finally, take the min of all four directions.
The maximum of these minimums is the answer.

Time complexity is O(N^2).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int N, vector<vector<int>>& mines) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(N, vector<int>(N, 1));
        
        for (vector<int> &mine : mines) {
            grid[mine[0]][mine[1]] = 0;
        }
        
        
        vector<vector<int>> up(N,vector<int>(N, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> down(N,vector<int>(N, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> left(N,vector<int>(N, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> right(N,vector<int>(N, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    up[i][j] = 1 + (i - 1 >= 0? up[i - 1][j] : 0);
                    left[i][j] = 1 + (j - 1 >= 0? left[i][j - 1] : 0);
                } else {
                    up[i][j] = left[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int reval(0);
        for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = N - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    down[i][j] = 1 + (i + 1 < N? down[i + 1][j] : 0);
                    right[i][j] = 1 + (j + 1 < N? right[i][j + 1] : 0);
                } else {
                    down[i][j] = right[i][j] = 0;
                }
                
                // We can calculate the cross radius for this cell now.
                reval = std::max(reval, std::min( std::min(up[i][j], down[i][j]), 
                                                  std::min(left[i][j], right[i][j]))
                                );
            }
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
};
```

### Solution three, 86ms

__Algorithms__: For each position (i, j) of the grid matrix, we try to extend in each of the four directions (left, right, up, down) as long as possible, then take the minimum length of 1's out of the four directions as the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign centered at position (i, j).

__Optimizations__: Normally we would need a total of five matrices to make the above idea work -- one matrix for the grid itself and four more matrices for each of the four directions. However, these five matrices can be combined into one using two simple tricks:

For each position (i, j), we are only concerned with the minimum length of 1's out of the four directions. This implies we may combine the four matrices into one by only keeping tracking of the minimum length.

For each position (i, j), the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign centered at it will be 0 if and only if grid[i][j] == 0. This implies we may further combine the grid matrix with the one obtained above.

__Implementations__:

1. Create an N-by-N matrix grid, with all elements initialized with value N.
2. Reset those elements to 0 whose positions are in the mines list.
3. For each position (i, j), find the maximum length of 1's in each of the four directions and set grid[i][j] to the minimum of these four lengths. Note that there is a simple recurrence relation relating the maximum length of 1's at current position with previous position for each of the four directions (labeled as l, r, u, d).
4. Loop through the grid matrix and choose the maximum element which will be the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1's contained in the grid.


Basically these four lines are computing the longest streak of 1's for each grid position along the four directions: left, right, up, down, represented respectively by the four variables l, r, u, d.

Take the variable l as an example. Starting from the grid position grid[i][j], what is the longest streak of 1's that you can extend to its left? Well, the answer is as follows: if grid[i][j] itself is 0, then no streak of 1's can be formed whatsoever so we have l = 0; otherwise it will be the longest streak of 1's ending at grid[i][j-1] plus 1, so we have l = l + 1 (the original recurrence relation is something like L[i][j] = L[i][j-1] + 1, which normally requires an array, but since the value at index j only depends on those at index j-1, we can cut down the space by using only one variable).

Similar ideas for the other three directions. One more trick I'm using here is to combine all the four directions in one loop, by taking advantage of the fact that the grid is a square matrix (which may be confusing). The indices i, j and k will assume different roles for each of the directions, as shown below:

* For the left direction, i is a row index while j is a column index. For each row, j goes from left to right (increasing).

* For the right direction, i is a row index while k is a column index. For each row, k goes from right to left (decreasing).

* For the up direction, i is a column index while j is a row index. For each column, j goes from top to bottom (increasing).

* For the down direction, i is a column index while k is a row index. For each column, k goes from bottom to top (decreasing).

We can use this trick because this grid is a ```N * N``` grid, which has very good symmetry. When we visit each row, we have ```l``` scan from left to right, ```r``` scan from right to left, and for current node ```grid[i][j]'s``` mirror node(mirrored against diagonal) ```grid[j][i]```ï¼Œwe have ```u``` scan from top to bottom and ```d``` scan from bottom to left. And when we visited node ```grid[j][i]```, we will scan from left to right and from right to left for it, and same for its "mirror node" ```grid[i][j]``` we will scan from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Right now for both node, we have all the top/bottom/left/right get checked. This works for all the nodes.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int N, vector<vector<int>>& mines) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(N, vector<int>(N, N));
        
        for (auto& m : mines) {
            grid[m[0]][m[1]] = 0;
        }
        
        // Here we first get the left/right for i==0 row, up/down for i==0 column.
        // then we get left/right for i==1 row, up/down for i==1 column.
        // and then left/right for i==2 row, up/down for i==2 colum,
        // etc... And eventually we will have left/right/up/down for any cell.
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            
            // Here, l,r,u,d represent the length of consecutive 1 in left/right/up/down direction
            // from current cell.
            for (int j = 0, k = N - 1, l = 0, r = 0, u = 0, d = 0; j < N; j++, k--) {
                // j is a column index, iterate from left to right
                // every time check how far left it can reach.
                // if grid[i][j] is 0, l needs to start over from 0 again, otherwise increment
                grid[i][j] = min(grid[i][j], l = (grid[i][j] == 0 ? 0 : l + 1));

                // every time check how far right it can reach.

                grid[i][k] = min(grid[i][k], r = (grid[i][k] == 0 ? 0 : r + 1));
                
                // j is a row index, iterate from top to bottom
                // every time check how far up it can reach.
                // if grid[j][i] is 0, u needs to start over from 0 again, otherwise increment
                grid[j][i] = min(grid[j][i], u = (grid[j][i] == 0 ? 0 : u + 1));
                
                // k is a row index, iterate from bottom to top
                // every time check how far down it can reach.
                // if grid[k][i] is 0, d needs to start over from 0 again, otherwise increment
                grid[k][i] = min(grid[k][i], d = (grid[k][i] == 0 ? 0 : d + 1));
