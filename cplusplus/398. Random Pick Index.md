Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

```
int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. 
// Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);
```

# Solution

### Solution 1, Reservoir Sampling

Even though this solution passed leetcode tests, I don't think it is correct.

Because it is clearly stated that "The array size can be very large.", we should not store the numbers in member variable.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int> nums) : m_nums(nums){
    }
    
    int pick(int target) {
        std::size_t pos(-1), count(0);
        for (std::size_t i = 0, n = m_nums.size(); i < n; ++i) {
            if (m_nums[i] == target) {
                ++ count;
                if (rand() % count == 0) { // make sure have probability 1/count to replace the previous index
                    pos = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return pos;
    }
private:
    vector<int> m_nums;
};
```

### Reservoir Sampling

Let's say you have an array of n elements, and you want to pick a random element from the array.  This is easy - choose each element with probability 1/n.

But say you receive the elements one at a time, and you don't know how many elements there are going to be.  How would you do it then?  You don't know what n is, so you can't pick each element with probability 1/n.  In theory you could wait for all the elements to come and then do what you did before.  But the stream could be very long, making this infeasible.  We want a solution where you don't store elements and you don't look at them twice.

As it happens, you can do this as follows:

1. Choose the first element with probability 1  
2. Replace the first element with the second element, with probability 1/2  
3. Replace the current element with the third element, with probability 1/3  
4. Continue doing this until the stream ends.  

This algorithm takes constant space and linear time.

Why does it work?  Let's say you have three elements.

1. The probability of choosing the first element (by the end) is P(not replacing with second element) * P(not replacing with third element) = 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3  
2. The probability of choosing the second element is P(replacing first element with second element) * P(not replacing second element with third element) = 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3  
3. The probability of choosing the third element is P(replacing an element with the third element) = 1/3  

In general you can prove correctness by induction.  Suppose that after seeing n-1 elements, each of the first n-1 elements is chosen with equal probability.  When you see the nth element, it is chosen with probability 1/n, and each of the other elements is chosen with probability [1/(n-1)] * [(n-1) / n] = 1/n.  Therefore all elements are chosen with equal probability.



# A mistake I made

__Below solution is not working!__

I tried to save the iterators only but did not pass the leetcode tests, it might be because that the input vector may have been destroyed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int> nums) {
        vec_begin = nums.begin();
        vec_end = nums.end();
    }
    
    int pick(int target) {
        vector<int>::iterator pos(vec_end);
        std::size_t count(0);
        for (vector<int>::iterator iter = vec_begin; iter != vec_end; ++iter) {
            if (*iter == target) {
                ++ count;
                if (random() % count == 0) {
                    pos = iter;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return pos - vec_begin;
    }
private:
    vector<int>::iterator vec_begin, vec_end;
};
```

In order for above solution to work, we need to _pass nums by reference_ there, this is related to C++ handle lifetime of parameter.


If we save the nums, then it works.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int> nums) :m_nums(nums){
        vec_begin = m_nums.begin();
        vec_end = m_nums.end();
    }
    
    int pick(int target) {
        vector<int>::iterator pos(vec_end);
        std::size_t count(0);
        for (vector<int>::iterator iter = vec_begin; iter != vec_end; ++iter) {
            if (*iter == target) {
                ++ count;
                if (rand() % count == 0) {
                    pos = iter;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return pos - vec_begin;
    }
private:
    vector<int> m_nums;
    vector<int>::iterator vec_begin, vec_end;
};
```
