You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

#### Example 1:

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

#### Note:

* S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in J are distinct.

# Solution

First, read J and build jewels hash set.
Second, read S and count jewels.

I used hash set so that the time complexity will be O(M+N).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        int reval(0);
        std::unordered_set<char> jewels_types(J.begin(), J.end());
        for (char stone : S) {
            reval += jewels_types.count(stone);
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
