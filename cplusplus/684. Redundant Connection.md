In this problem, a tree is an __undirected graph__ that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair ```[u, v]``` with ```u < v```, that represents an __undirected edge__ connecting nodes ```u``` and ```v```.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge ```[u, v]``` should be in the same format, with ```u < v```.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```

#### Note:

* The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
* Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int findUnionRoot(int node, unordered_map<int, int> &parents) {
        while (node != parents[node]) {
            node = parents[node] = parents[parents[node]];
        }
        return node;
    }
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_map<int, int> parents;
        
        for (int node = 1; node <= edges.size(); ++node) {
            parents[node] = node;
        }
        
        vector<int> reval;
        for (const vector<int> &edge : edges) {
            int root_of_from = findUnionRoot(edge[0], parents);
            int root_of_to = findUnionRoot(edge[1], parents);
            
            if (root_of_from == root_of_to) {
                return edge;
            } else {
                parents[root_of_from] = root_of_to;
            }
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
