Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
For example,

```
Given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Return

 [
    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
  ]
```

Note:  
* Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.


# Solution

This is a graph problem. If we treat each word as a graph node(vertex), then the problem becomes find the shortest path from one graph node to another graph node. Real-life examples can be, "find the shortest path from one bus station to another bus station".

Here we use bidirectional-BFS to build the graph, ```graph[cur_word]``` is an unordered_set of words that ```cur_word``` can be reached, of course you need to make sure all the words(graph nodes) are in the ```wordList``` provided. In this bidirectional-BFS, we have left graph nodes layer, and right graph nodes layer. This bidirectional-BFS should end as long as there is any graph node in "right" layer can be reached from graph nodes in "left" layer(quoted here becuse in bi-BFS, left ane right layer are switched sometimes). Everytime before we process the "left" layer, we erase its words from the dictionary, thus to avoid re-visit graph node(A node in current left layer => B in next left nodes, also means B => A) as well as avoid unnecessary calculation(if both A and B are within current left layer nodes, A=>B can be avoided).


After bidirectional-BFS, we have a graph to represent the relationship from one word to another word. Right now we can find the shortest-path by using DFS.

Since both BFS and DFS have time complexity ```O(number_of_edges + number_of_vertices)```, this solution's time complexity is ```O(number_of_edges + number_of_vertices)```.


__Note that this graph doesn't have weight, therefore we can use BFS to solve it. If the edge here has weight,  Dijkstra algorithm might be a better option.__

### Solution 2, same method as solution 1, just with unit test

We are required to return the SHORTEST transformation sequences in the end. How to build the transformation sequence then? It turns out if we can store the next transformation words for each word, then we can build the paths based on that.
Therefore, a HashMap stores <word, vector<next-transformation>> pairs will be a good choice.

How to generate the transformation mapper? Using BFS! Moreover, we can use Bi-directional BFS. Bi-direction BFS means simultaneously run two BFS's from both source and target vertices, terminating once a vertex common to both runs is discovered. We can return the transformation mapper once the common vertices are found, because we are find __SHORTEST__ sequences.

The principle of this solution is : we can generate a graph from begin_word to end_word. The graph is similar from one geo-location to another geo-location, and there are many paths to it. "nexts" gives all the next stops every word can reach (the direction is from beginWord to endWord). Once we complete "nexts", we can generate the all the shortest ladders based on it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> findLadders(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> begin_words = {beginWord}, end_words= {endWord};
        unordered_set<string> word_set(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        if (word_set.count(endWord) == 0) {
            // Note that endWord is required to be a transformed word, but beginWord is not
            return vector<vector<string>>();
        }
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> nexts;
        vector<vector<string>> ladders;
        vector<string> ladder;
        if (BidirectionalBFS(begin_words, end_words, word_set, nexts, true)) {
            generateLadders(beginWord, endWord, nexts, ladders, ladder);
        }
        
        return ladders;
    }
    
private:
      // This function will generate the final ladders based on the relationship defined in "nexts".

         }

    // Perform bidirectional BFS, return true if ladder exist.

# Knowledge

### Bidirectional search

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search

__Bidirectional search__ is a graph search algorithm that finds a shortest path from an initial vertex to a goal vertex in a directed graph. It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the initial state, and one backward from the goal, stopping when the two meet in the middle. The reason for this approach is that in many cases it is faster.

__Note that this graph doesn't have weight, therefore we can use BFS to solve it. If the edge here has weight, we need to use Dijkstra algorithm.__

In normal graph search using BFS/DFS we begin our search in one direction usually from source vertex toward the goal vertex, but what if we start search form both direction simultaneously. Bidirectional search is a graph search algorithm which find smallest path form source to goal vertex. It runs two simultaneous search 

1. Forward search form source/initial vertex toward goal vertex
2. Backward search form goal/target vertex toward source vertex

Bidirectional search replaces single search graph(which is likely to grow exponentially) with two smaller sub graphs – one starting from initial vertex and other starting from goal vertex. The search terminates when two graphs intersect.


### Dijkstra  vs BFS vs DFS

Dijkstra allows assigning distances other than 1 for each  step. For example, in routing the distances (or weights) could be  assigned by speed, cost, preference, etc. The algorithm then gives you  the shortest path from your source to every node in the traversed graph.

Meanwhile BFS basically just expands the search by one “step” (link,  edge, whatever you want to call it in your application) on every  iteration, which happens to have the effect of finding the smallest number of steps it takes to get to any given node from your source (“root”).

Comparing BFS and DFS,  depending on the data and what you are looking for, either DFS or BFS could be advantageous.

For example, given a family  tree if one were looking for someone  on the tree who’s still alive, then it would be safe to assume that  person  would be on the bottom of the tree. This means that a BFS  would   take a very long time to reach that last level.  A DFS, however, would find the goal faster.    

But, if one were  looking for a family member who died a very long   time ago, then that  person would be closer to the top  of the tree.  Then, a BFS would  usually be faster than a DFS. So, the advantages  of either vary depending on the data and what   you’re looking for.
