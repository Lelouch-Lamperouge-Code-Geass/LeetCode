Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].

Note:

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.  
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?  
  
# Solution
  
Once again, we need to use XOR to solve this problem. But this time, we need to do it in two passes:

1. In the first pass, we XOR all elements in the array, and get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find. Note that since the two numbers are distinct, so there must be a set bit (that is, the bit with value ‘1’) in the XOR result. Find
out an arbitrary set bit (for example, the rightmost set bit).

2. In the second pass, we divide all numbers into two groups, one with the aforementioned bit set, another with the aforementinoed bit unset. Two different numbers we need to find must fall into thte two distrinct groups. XOR numbers in each group, we can find a number in either group.

__Complexity: Time: O (n)   Space: O (1).__

A Corner Case:

When diff == numeric_limits<int>::min(), -diff is also numeric_limits<int>::min(). Therefore, the value of diff after executing diff &= -diff is still numeric_limits<int>::min(). The answer is still correct.  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

  /*The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, 
    this is how we can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.

Let’s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.

Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i. the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0. the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.

Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.

by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number. by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number.*/
  vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Pass 1 :
    // Get the XOR of the two numbers we need to find
    int diff = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0, bit_xor<int>());
    // Get its rightmost set bit
    diff &= -diff;

    // Pass 2 :
    vector<int> rets = {0, 0}; // this vector stores the two numbers we will return
    for (int num : nums)
      {
        if ((num & diff) == 0) // the bit is not set
          {
            rets[0] ^= num;
          }
        else // the bit is set
          {
            rets[1] ^= num;
          }
      }
    return rets;
  }
};
```
