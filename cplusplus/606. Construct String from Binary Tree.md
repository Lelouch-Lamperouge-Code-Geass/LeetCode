You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
```

Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

##### Example 2:

```
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
```

Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, 
except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

# Solution

On each non-null node, after add its value, there are four cases:

1. Both children are null : this is easy, just ignore them.
2. Left child is not null but right child is null : we need add "(left-child)".
3. Left child is null but right child is not null : we need add "()(right-child)".
4. Both children are not null : we need add "(left-child)(right-child)".

Therefore, as long as a node has right child, we need to print the parenthesis for left child.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    void buildTreeString(TreeNode* t, ostringstream &oss) {
        if (t) {
            oss << t->val;
            
            if (t->left || t->right) {
                oss << '(';
                buildTreeString(t->left, oss);
                oss << ')';
            }
            
            if (t->right) {
                oss << '(';
                buildTreeString(t->right, oss);
                oss << ')';
            }
        }
    }
public:
    string tree2str(TreeNode* t) {
        ostringstream oss;
        buildTreeString(t, oss);
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```
