Given a non-empty string s and an integer k, rearrange the string such that the same characters are at least distance k from each other.

All input strings are given in lowercase letters. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string "".

#### Example 1:

```
s = "aabbcc", k = 3

Result: "abcabc"  

The same letters are at least distance 3 from each other.
```

#### Example 2:

```
s = "aaabc", k = 3 

Answer: ""

It is not possible to rearrange the string.
```

#### Example 3:

```
s = "aaadbbcc", k = 2

Answer: "abacabcd"

Another possible answer is: "abcabcda"

The same letters are at least distance 2 from each other.
```

# Solution

### Solution one

This is a greedy problem.
Every time we want to find the best candidate: which is the character with the largest remaining count. Thus we will be having two arrays.
One count array to store the remaining count of every character. Another array to keep track of the most left position that one character can appear.
We will iterated through these two array to find the best candidate for every position. Since the array is fixed size, it will take constant time to do this.
After we find the candidate, we update two arrays.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
      // Find the character with the largest remaining count.
      // Use valid array to keep track of the most left position that character can appear.
      // Since both array are fixed-size(256), the time-complexity of this function is constant.
      int findValidMax(const vector<int> &count, 
                       const vector<int> &valid, 
                       std::size_t index) {
        int max_count(0), candidate_char(-1);
        for (int i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
          if (valid[i] <= index && count[i] > max_count) {
            max_count = count[i];
            candidate_char = i;
          }
        }
        return candidate_char;
      }
      // Time complexity is O(n)
      std::string rearrangeString(std::string str, int k) {
        std::size_t str_size(str.size());
        vector<int> count(256, 0), valid(256, 0);
        for (char c : str) {
          ++ count[c];
        }

        std::string reval("");
        for (std::size_t index = 0; index < str_size; ++index) {
          int char_id = findValidMax(count, valid, index);
          if (char_id == -1) return "";
          --count[char_id];
          valid[char_id] = index +  k;
          reval.push_back((char)char_id);
        }
        return reval;
      }
};
```

### Solution two

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
      std::string rearrangeString(std::string str, int k) {
            if(k == 0) return str;
            int length = (int)str.size();

            std::string res("");
            vector<int> counter(26, 0);
          
            // <count, char> priority queue
            std::priority_queue<std::pair<int, char>> pq;

            for(char ch : str) ++counter[ch - 'a'];
            for(int i = 0; i < 26; ++i){
              if (counter[i] > 0) pq.push(std::make_pair(counter[i], 'a' + i));
            }

            while(!pq.empty()){
              std::vector<std::pair<int, char>> cache; //store used char during one while loop
              int count = std::min(k, length); //count: how many steps in a while loop
              for(int i = 0; i < count; i++){
                if(pq.empty()) return "";
                auto tmp = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                res.push_back(tmp.second);
                if(--tmp.first > 0) cache.push_back(tmp);
                --length;
              }
              for(auto p : cache) pq.push(p);
            }
            return res;
      }
};
```

### Solution three

The idea is pretty simple.
for example, you have (aaaabbbbcccddeef, 4) how would you do it:

```
0. Count how many occurrences of each character: a:4, b:4, c:3, d:2, e:1 
1. put the most 2 characters (ab) at least k apart first as reference point:
abXXabXXabXXab (X is empty position)
2. then fill the gap with all other numbers from most frequency to least frequency like filling out a rotated array:
   2.1 fill with c first:  abCXabCXabCXab
   2.2 fill with d then: abcDabcDabcXab
   2.3 fill with e:    abcdEabcdabcEab    // Here, first E is actually put last, second E is put first, because we are filling gaps in rotated manner. Note, it doesn't matter if it runs out of empty space, just insert E after abcd anyway, it won't break anything;
   2.4 fill with f:   abcdeabcdfabceab //A valid solution is generated.

3. Finally, how to determine if there is a solution:
    It's easy: At step 2, if you can't fill all the all empty positions with remaining characters after step 1, there is no solution.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
      std::string rearrangeString(std::string str, int k) {
            int char_map [26] = {0};
            for (int i = 0 ;  i < str.size(); ++i)
                ++ char_map[str[i] - 'a'] ;
            multimap<int, char, greater<int>> count_map;
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
                count_map.emplace(char_map[i], i + 'a');
            int max_cnt = count_map.begin()->first, pos = 0;
            string str_arr[max_cnt];
            for (auto iter = count_map.begin(); iter != count_map.end(); ++iter)
                for (int i = 0; i < iter->first; ++i, pos = (pos + 1) % max(iter->first, max_cnt - 1))
                    str_arr[pos].push_back(iter->second);
            string result;
            for (int i = 0; i < max_cnt - 1; ++i)
                if (str_arr[i].size() < k) return "";
                else result += str_arr[i];
            result += str_arr[max_cnt - 1];
            return result;
      }
};
```
