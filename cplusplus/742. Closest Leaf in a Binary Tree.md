Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key k, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target k in the tree.

Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.

##### Example 1:

```
Input:
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output: 2 (or 3)
```

Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.

##### Example 2:

```
Input:
root = [1], k = 1
Output: 1

```

Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.

##### Example 3:

```
Input:
root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

Output: 3
```

Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.

#### Note:

* root represents a binary tree with at least 1 node and at most 1000 nodes.
* Every node has a unique node.val in range [1, 1000].
* There exists some node in the given binary tree for which node.val == k.

# Solution

Note that the closest leaf node can be a any leaf node, doesn't necessary come from its children.

Treat the tree as an undirected graph and perform BFS from the target node to find the first leaf node.

Since every node has a unique value, below solution's graph can use integer instead of the tree node.

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
