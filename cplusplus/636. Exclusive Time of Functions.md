Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive single threaded CPU, find the exclusive time of these functions.

Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. A function may be called recursively or by another function.

A log is a string has this format : function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. For example, ```"0:start:0"``` means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time 0. ```"0:end:0"``` means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0.

Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this function, the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered as this function's exclusive time. You should return the exclusive time of each function sorted by their function id.

##### Example 1:

```
Input:
n = 2
logs = 
["0:start:0",
 "1:start:2",
 "1:end:5",
 "0:end:6"]
Output:[3, 4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1. 
Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2, 
executes 4 units of time and end at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at time 6, and also end at the time 6, thus executes 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally execute 4 units of time.
```


#### Note:

1. Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id.
2. Your output should be sorted by function id, which means the 0th element of your output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0.
3. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
4. Functions could be called recursively, and will always end.
5. 1 <= n <= 100

# Solution

We use a stack to store function-id, and ```quota_start``` to store the start-timestamp of current time-splice. 

Whenever we see a "start" which means we are going to run a new function, calculate the running time for previous function, push the new function id into stack, and update ```quota_start```.

Whenever we see a "end" which means we are going to stop running current function, calculate the running time for current function, pop its id out of stack, and update ```quota_start```.

Note that here ```start``` and ```end``` are inclusive. So for example ```[..., {0:start:3}]``` and ```item = {0 : end :6}``` we add ```6 + 1 - 3```.

However, what if there is a new function call before current function is ended? We calculate the execution time for current function, and begin to execution the new function. __Note that a function can call itself, so it is possible we have cases similar to ```["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]```__.

In summary, when we begin a function call, we add the execution time of previous function, and push current function-id into stack. When we end a function call, and add the execution time for current function, and  we pop the top item out of the stack which is the same as current function-id.

__Time complexity is O(number-of-logs), space complexity is O(number-of-functions).__


##### Pitfall

```
["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
```

is also a valid input, because function can call itself recursively.


```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    vector<string> splitBy(const string &str, char delimiter) {
        vector<string> reval;
        size_t begin(0), end(0); 
        
        while (end != std::string::npos) {
            end = str.find_first_of(delimiter, begin);
            reval.emplace_back(str.substr(begin, end - begin));
            
            begin = end + 1;
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
public:
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        // Stores the running time of each function
        vector<int> running_time_of_func(n, 0);
        
        // Whenever a new function begin to run, push its id to stack
        stack<int> func_ids;
        
        // Beginning timestamp of current time-slice(quanta).
        int begin_timestamp_of_curr_quanta(0);
        
        for (const string &log_line : logs) {
            const vector<string> &strs = splitBy(log_line, ':');

            const int func_id = std::stoi(strs[0]);
            const string &func_type = strs[1];
            const int timestamp = std::stoi(strs[2]);
            
            if (func_type == "start") {
                if (!func_ids.empty()) {
                    running_time_of_func[func_ids.top()] += timestamp - begin_timestamp_of_curr_quanta;
                }
                func_ids.push(func_id);
                begin_timestamp_of_curr_quanta= timestamp;
            } else { // func_type == "end"
                running_time_of_func[func_ids.top()] += timestamp + 1 - begin_timestamp_of_curr_quanta;
                func_ids.pop();
                
                 // Note here next quanta begins after current timestamp
                begin_timestamp_of_curr_quanta = timestamp + 1;
            }
            
            
        }
        
        return running_time_of_func;
    }
};
```

A different style.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    vector<string> splitBy(const string &str, char delimiter) {
        istringstream iss(str);
        vector<string> reval;
        string temp("");
        while (std::getline(iss, temp, delimiter)) {
            reval.emplace_back(temp);
        }
        return reval;
    }
public:
    vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
        vector<int> reval(n, 0);
        stack<int> func_ids;
        int quanta_start(0);
        for (const string &log_entry : logs) {
            vector<string> items = splitBy(log_entry, ':');
            int func_id = std::stoi(items[0]);
            int timestamp = std::stoi(items[2]);
            
            if (items[1] == "start") {
                if (!func_ids.empty()) {
                    reval[func_ids.top()] += timestamp - quanta_start;
                }
                quanta_start = timestamp;
                func_ids.push(func_id);
            } else { // items[1] == "end"
                reval[func_id] += timestamp + 1 - quanta_start;
                func_ids.pop();
                quanta_start = timestamp + 1;
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
