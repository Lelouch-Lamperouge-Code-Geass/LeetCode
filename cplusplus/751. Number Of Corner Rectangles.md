Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.
```

##### Note:

1. The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
2. Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
3. The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.

# Solution

To find an axis-aligned rectangle, my idea is to fix two rows (or two columns) first, then check column by column to find "1" on both rows. Say you find n pairs, then just pick any 2 of those to form an axis-aligned rectangle (calculating how many in total is just high school math, hint: combination).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCornerRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int reval(0);
        
        for (int row = 0, row_size = grid.size(); row < row_size; ++row) {
            for (int second_row = row + 1; second_row < row_size; ++second_row) {
                int count(0);
                for (int col = 0, col_size = grid[row].size(); col < col_size; ++col) {
                    if  (grid[row][col] == 1 && grid[second_row][col] == 1) {
                        ++ count;
                    }
                }
                
                
                // Pick 2 lines out of count lines, Combination(n, 2)
                reval += count * (count - 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
};
```
