Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:
1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

Example 1:  
```
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].
```

Example 2:  
```
tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.
```


# Solution

__Just Eulerian path. Greedy DFS, building the route backwards when retreating.__

First keep going forward until you get stuck. That's a good main path already. Remaining tickets form cycles which are found on the way back and get merged into that main path. By writing down the path backwards when retreating from recursion, merging the cycles into the main path is easy - the end part of the path has already been written, the start part of the path hasn't been written yet, so just write down the cycle now and then keep backwards-writing the path.

From JFK we first visit JFK -> A -> C -> D -> A. There we're stuck, so we write down A as the end of the route and retreat back to D. There we see the unused ticket to B and follow it: D -> B -> C -> JFK -> D. Then we're stuck again, retreat and write down the airports while doing so: Write down D before the already written A, then JFK before the D, etc. When we're back from our cycle at D, the written route is D -> B -> C -> JFK -> D -> A. Then we retreat further along the original path, prepending C, A and finally JFK to the route, ending up with the route JFK -> A -> C -> D -> B -> C -> JFK -> D -> A.

The following is my summary:
1. The nodes which have odd degrees (int and out) are the entrance or exit. In your example it's JFK and A.
2. If there are no nodes have odd degrees, we could follow any path without stuck until hit the last exit node
3. The reason we got stuck is because that we hit the exit

In the example, nodes A is the exit node, we hit it and it's the exit. So we put it to the result as the last node.

Starting at the first node, we can only get stuck at the ending point, since every node except for the first and the last node has even number of edges, when we enter a node we can always get out. Now we are at the destination and if all edges are visited, we are done, and the dfs returns to the very first state. Otherwise we need to "insert" the unvisited loop into corresponding position, and in the dfs method, it returns to the node with extra edges, starts another recursion and adds the result before the next path. This process continues until all edges are visited.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<pair<string, string>> tickets) {
        // multiset<string> sort string by lexical order naturally
        std::unordered_map<std::string, std::multiset<std::string>> itineraries;
        for (const std::pair<std::string, std::string> &ticket : tickets) {
            itineraries[ticket.first].insert(ticket.second);
        }
        std::vector<std::string> route;
        visit("JFK", itineraries, route);
        return std::vector<std::string>(route.rbegin(), route.rend());
    }
    
private:
        void visit(const std::string &airport, 
                   std::unordered_map<std::string, std::multiset<std::string>> & itineraries,
                   std::vector<std::string> & route) {
            while(!itineraries[airport].empty()) {
                const std::string next = *itineraries[airport].begin();
                itineraries[airport].erase(itineraries[airport].begin());
                visit(next, itineraries, route);
            }
            
            route.push_back(airport);
        }
};
```

# Knowledge

### What is Eulerian trail and what is Eulerian cycle ?
In graph theory, an __Eulerian trail__ (or __Eulerian path__) is a trail in a finite graph which visits __every edge exactly once__. Similarly, an __Eulerian circuit__ or __Eulerian cycle__ is an Eulerian trail which starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this: "Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a cycle, i.e. a path starting and ending on the same vertex) which visits each edge exactly once?".

Euler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of __Eulerian circuits__ is that all vertices in the graph have an even degree, and stated without proof that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit. 

__Note : Eulerian Cycle and Eulerian Path are different !__


### What is the difference between Euler cycle and Hamilton cycle?

A Euler path is a path that crosses __every edge__ exactly once without repeating, if it ends at the initial vertex then it is a Euler cycle.

A Hamiltonian path passes through __each vertex__ (note not each edge), exactly once, if it ends at the initial vertex then it is a Hamiltonian cycle.

In a Euler path you might pass through a vertex more than once.

In a Hamiltonian path you may not pass though all edges.

### EULER’S THEOREMS

Euler’s Theorem 1
```
If a graph has any vertices of odd degree, then it CANNOT have an EULER CIRCUIT.
AND
If a graph is connected and every vertex has even degree, then it has AT LEAST ONE EULER CIRCUIT (usually more).
```

Euler’s Theorem 2
```
If a graph has more than 2 vertices of odd degree, then it CANNOT have an EULER PATH.
AND
If a graph is connected and has exactly 2 vertices of odd degree, then it has AT LEAST ONE EULER PATH (usually more). 
Any such path must start at one of the odd-degree vertices and end at the other.
```

Euler’s Theorem 3
```
The sum of the degrees of all the vertices of a graph is an even number (exactly twice the number of edges). 
In every graph, the number of vertices of odd degree must be even.
```

### Topological Sorting

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
For example, a topological sorting of the following graph is “5 4 2 3 1 0”. There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. For example, another topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 3 1 0”. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).

#### Topological Sorting vs Depth First Traversal (DFS):

In DFS, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we need to print a vertex before its adjacent vertices. For example, in the given graph, the vertex ‘5’ should be printed before vertex ‘0’, but unlike DFS, the vertex ‘4’ should also be printed before vertex ‘0’. So Topological sorting is different from DFS. For example, a DFS of the shown graph is “5 2 3 1 0 4”, but it is not a topological sorting.
