Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

#### Example 1:

```
Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input:
        2
       / \
      1   3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
```

__Note:__ All the values of tree nodes are in the range of [-1e7, 1e7].

# Solution

On each tree node, we calculate:

* The length of longest increasing path including itself : if ```current node's value == any child's value + 1 ```, then we can add that child's longest increasing path length, which means we can append current node to that path; else we know that the longest increasing path on current node can only contains itself.  
* The length of longest decreasing path including itself : same idea as above.  

And if we add above length together(of course we need to minus one since both take current node to its length), it becomes the longest path which contains current node. For example, current node is ```5```, and we have a longest increasing path including it, ```[1,2,3,4, 5]```, and a longest decreasing path including it ```[9,8,7,6,5]```, then we know we can have a path ```[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]```.

In summary, on each tree node, we will have:

* The length of longest increasing path including itself.
* The length of longest decreasing path including itself.
* The length of longest path including itself (so far, since we have not process pending nodes yet).
