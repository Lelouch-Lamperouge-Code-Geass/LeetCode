Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

Note: If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

# Solution

The inorder traversal of a BST is the nodes in ascending order. To find a successor, you just need to find the smallest one that is larger than the given value since there are no duplicate values in a BST. It just like the binary search in a sorted list. The time complexity should be O(h) where h is the depth of the result node. ```succ``` is a pointer that keeps the possible successor. __Whenever you go left the current root is the new possible successor, otherwise the it remains the same.__

Initially, the ```succ``` is nullptr, and we are at root node. As long as we are moving to right child, suc will not be changed. suc will only be updated when we turn left. Turning left means we meet a smaller node which is larger than the give value. 

Only in a balanced ```BST O(h) = O(log n)```. In the worst case h can be as large as n.


The idea is to compare root's value with p's value if root is not null, and consider the following two cases:

1. ```root.val > p.val```. In this case, root can be a possible answer, so we store the root node first and call it res. However, we don't know if there is anymore node on root's left that is larger than p.val. So we move root to its left and check again.

2. ```root.val <= p.val```. In this case, root cannot be p's inorder successor, neither can root's left child. So we only need to consider root's right child, thus we move root to its right and check again.

__Note that we can't stop when we meet node p, since we are looking for its successor. It is possible that we have not visited its sucessor when we meet p.__

For example, if p is the node 2 in this graph.

```
     2
    / \
null   3
        \
         4
```


__Time complexity O(h), space complexity O(1).__

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        TreeNode *successor(nullptr);
        while (root) {
            if (root->val > p->val) {
                successor = root;
                root = root->left;
            } else if (root->val < p->val){
                root = root->right;
            } else { // root->val == p->val, right now root == p
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        return successor;
    }
};
```

Simplify a little bit.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        TreeNode *reval(nullptr);
        while (root) {
            if (root->val > p->val) {
                reval = root;
                root = root->left;
            } else { // root->val <= p->val
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
};
```


### Recursive version

__Time complexity O(h), space complexity O(h).__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        if (root->val < p->val) {
            return inorderSuccessor(root->right, p);
        } else if (root->val > p->val) {
            TreeNode *sub_result = inorderSuccessor(root->left, p);
            return sub_result ? sub_result : root;
        } else { // root->val == p->val
            return inorderSuccessor(root->right, p);
        }
    }
};
```
