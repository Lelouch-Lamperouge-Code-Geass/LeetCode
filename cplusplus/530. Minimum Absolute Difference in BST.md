Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

Example:

```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, 
which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
```

__Note:__ There are at least two nodes in this BST.

# Solution

Since this is a binary-search-tree, if we perform a in-order-traversal, then the closest nodes are next to each other.

Time complexity O(N), space complexity O(height of tree).

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int getMinimumDifference(TreeNode* root) {
        int min_diff(INT_MAX);
        stack<TreeNode*> nodes;
        TreeNode *pre(nullptr);
        while (root || !nodes.empty()) {
            if (root) {
                nodes.push(root);
                root = root->left;
            } else {
                root = nodes.top();
                nodes.pop();
                if (pre) {
                    min_diff = std::min(min_diff, std::abs(root->val - pre->val));
                }
                pre = root;
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        return min_diff;
    }
};
```
