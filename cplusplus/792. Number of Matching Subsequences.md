Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.

```
Example :
Input: 
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

#### Note:

* All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.  
* The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].  
* The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].  
* The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].  

# Solution


### A TLE solution

This is a very intuitive solution. The time complexity of ```isSubsequence``` is ```O(SizeOfStr)```. Therefore in worst case, the time complexity of ```numMatchingSubseq``` is ```O(SizeOfStr * NumberOfWords)```.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool isSubsequence(const string &str,
                       const string &word) {
        size_t str_index(0), word_index(0);
        const size_t str_size(str.size()), word_size(word.size());
        
        while (str_index < str_size && word_index < word_size) {
            if (str[str_index] == word[word_index]) {
                ++ word_index;
            }
            ++ str_index;
        }
        return word_index == word_size;
    }
public:
    int numMatchingSubseq(string S, vector<string>& words) {
        int count(0);
        for (const string &word : words) {
            if (isSubsequence(S, word)) {
                ++ count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Solution one

General Idea: Brute force checking will time out, we need efficent way to look up words.

1. Create an vector that stores indices for each character a-z in S
2. Then for each word, do a binary search for next index for current character in word that is greater than the index we last found for the alst character.
3. If it doesn't exist, word doesn't exist, otherwise continue to search for word.


__Side note: At first I used ```vector<vector<size_t>>```, but it gives wrong result. Need to investiate more about it.__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numMatchingSubseq(string S, vector<string>& words) {
        vector<vector<int>> char_positions(26, vector<int>());
        for (size_t i = 0, n = S.size(); i < n; ++i) {
            char_positions[S[i] - 'a'].emplace_back(i);
        }
        int reval(0);
        for (const string &word : words) {
            int char_pos = -1;
            bool found_subsequence(true);
            for (char c : word) {
                const vector<int> &cur_char_positions = char_positions[c - 'a'];
                auto iter = upper_bound(cur_char_positions.begin(), 
                                        cur_char_positions.end(), 
                                        char_pos);
                if (iter == cur_char_positions.end()) {
                    found_subsequence = false;
                } else {
                    char_pos = *iter ;
                }
            }
            if (found_subsequence) ++ reval;
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
