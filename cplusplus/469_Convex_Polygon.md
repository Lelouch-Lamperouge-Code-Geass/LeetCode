Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

Note:

1. There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
2. Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
3. You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.

Example 1:

```
[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]

Answer: True

        // find the cross product AB Â· BC. If the sign of
        // all the cross products is the same, the angles
        // are all positive or negative (depending on the
        // order in which we visit them) so the polygon
        // is convex.
