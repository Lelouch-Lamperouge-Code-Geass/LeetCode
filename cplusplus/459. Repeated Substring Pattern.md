Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

#### Example 1
  
```  
Input: "abab"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: "aba"

Output: False
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: "abcabcabcabc"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```  

# Solution

### Solution one

This solution is much worse than solution two, and it is my first solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s) {
    if (s.empty()) return true;
    const std::size_t s_size(s.size());

    for (std::size_t len = s_size / 2; len >= 1; --len) {
      if (s_size % len == 0) {
        std::size_t repeated_times(s_size / len);
        bool match_pattern(true);
        const std::string & substring = s.substr(0, len);
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i < repeated_times; ++i) {
          if (s.substr(i * len, len) != substring) {
            match_pattern = false;
            break;
          }
        }
        if (match_pattern) return true;
      }
    }

    return false;
  }
};
```

### Solution two
  
In summary, here is the basic idea:

1. First char of input string is first char of repeated substring.
2. Last char of input string is last char of repeated substring
3. Let ```S1 = S + S``` (where S in input string).
4. Remove 1 and last char of S1. Let this be S2.
5. If S exists in S2 then return true else false.
6. Let i be index in S2 where S starts then repeated substring length i + 1 and repeated substring ```S[0: i+1]```.

The explanation for why that works is pretty straight forward.
  
Consider a string ```S="helloworld"```. Now, given another string ```T="lloworldhe"```, can we figure out if T is a rotated version of S? Yes, we can! We check if ```S``` is a substring of ```T + T```. This works because ```T + T``` contains all the rotated variations of ```T```. For example, if ```T``` is ```"abc"```, then ```"abcabc"``` contains "abc", "bca", "cba" which are all the rotated versions of "abc", and also that every substring with ```size == 3``` in "abcabc" is a rotated variation of "abc", but nothing else.

How do we apply that to this problem? We consider every rotation of string S such that it's rotated by k units [k < len(S)] to the left. Specifically, we're looking at strings "elloworldh", "lloworldhe", "loworldhel", etc...

If we have a string that is periodic (i.e. is made up of strings that are the same and repeat R times), then we can check if the string is equal to some rotation of itself, and if it is, then we know that the string is periodic.

Checking if S is a sub-string of ```(S+S)[1:-1]``` basically checks if the string is present in a rotation of itself for all values of R such that ```0 < R < len(S)```.


#### Proof

We use ```P1P2...Pn``` to represent ```s```, here ```Pi``` represents a segment not a character. After we concatenate two ```s``` and cut off the first and last char then we have a new string ```ss``` which can be represented as ```#P2...PnP1P2....Pn-1#```, here ```#``` represents a damaged segment.

If we can find ```s```, namely ```P1P2...Pn``` in ```#P2...PnP1P2....Pn-1#```, that means we can find one to one equality similar to ```P1 == Pi, P2 == Pi+1, .... Pn = P(i+n)%n```.

Roughly drawing a picture should be like this:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s) {
    const std::string & ss = s + s;
    const std::string & p = ss.substr(1, ss.size() - 2); // No first and last char

    return p.find(s) != std::string::npos;
  }
};
```
