We have two types of tiles: a ```2x1``` domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

```
XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
```

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a ```2 x N``` board? Return your answer modulo ```10^9 + 7```.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Example:

```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
```

#### Note:

* N  will be in range [1, 1000].
