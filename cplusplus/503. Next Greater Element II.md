Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

__Note:__ The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

# Solution

The approach is same as Next Greater Element I.

__Time complexity O(n), space complexity O(n).__

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> reval(n, -1);
        
        // We keep the indexes with decreasing number
        stack<int> index_stack;
        // With maximum 2 * n steps, we can get 
        // "next greater number" for all numbers.
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
            int num = nums[i % n]; 
            // For all previous smaller number, num is
            // their "next greater number".
            while (!index_stack.empty() && nums[index_stack.top()] < num) {
                reval[index_stack.top()] = num;
                index_stack.pop();
            }
            if (i < n) {
                index_stack.push(i);
            }
        }   
        return reval;
    }
};
```
