Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:

Given a binary tree 

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Solution

One thing we know for sure is that the longest path definitely begin with a leaf node and end with another leaf node. This is because if either one is not leaf node, then we add its child into the path and we will get a longer path.

This problem is asking for the longest path of the whole tree, and if we know the longest path of every node, then the result will be the maximum value of them. By thinking in this way, we break the original problem down into a collection of simpler subproblems.

For every node, ```length of longest path which pass it = MaxDepth of its left subtree + MaxDepth of its right subtree```.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int diameter(0);
        height_of_cur_node(root, diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
private:
    // Return height of current node. Also check the diameter of the tree rooted in current node.
    int height_of_cur_node(TreeNode* root, int& diameter) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            int height_of_left_child = height_of_cur_node(root->left, diameter);
            int height_of_right_child = height_of_cur_node(root->right, diameter);
            diameter = std::max(diameter, height_of_left_child + height_of_right_child);
            return 1 + std::max(height_of_left_child, height_of_right_child);
        }
    } 
};
```


# Knowledge

### What is the difference between tree depth and height?

I learned that depth and height are properties of a node:

* The __depth__ of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.A root node will have a depth of 0.
* The __height__ of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. A leaf node will have a height of 0.

Properties of a tree:

* The __height__ of a tree would be the height of its root node, or equivalently, the depth of its deepest node.
* The __diameter__ (or width) of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaf nodes. The tree below has a diameter of 6 nodes.
