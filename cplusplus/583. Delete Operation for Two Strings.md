Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" 
  and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

#### Note:

* The length of given words won't exceed 500.
* Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

# Solution

### Solution one

Use typical "edit distance" methodology.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        if (word1.empty()) return word2.size();
        if (word2.empty()) return word1.size();
        
        const int word1_size(word1.size()), word2_size(word2.size());
        
        vector< vector<int> > min_steps(word1_size + 1, vector<int>(word2_size + 1, INT_MAX));
        
        min_steps[0][0] = 0;
        for (int len1 = 1; len1 <= word1_size; ++len1) min_steps[len1][0] = len1;
        for (int len2 = 1; len2 <= word2_size; ++len2) min_steps[0][len2] = len2;
        
        for (int len1 = 1; len1 <= word1_size; ++len1) {
            for (int len2 = 1; len2 <= word2_size; ++len2) {
                if (word1[len1 - 1] == word2[len2 - 1]) {
                    min_steps[len1][len2] = min_steps[len1 - 1][len2 - 1];
                } else {
                    min_steps[len1][len2] = 1 + std::min(min_steps[len1][len2 - 1],
                                                         min_steps[len1 - 1][len2]);
                    min_steps[len1][len2] = std::min(min_steps[len1][len2], 
                                                     min_steps[len1 - 1][len2 - 1] + 2);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return min_steps[word1_size][word2_size];
    }
};
```

### Solution two

Similar solution but from a different perspective.

To make them identical, just find the longest common subsequence. The rest of the characters have to be deleted from the both the strings, which does not belong to longest common subsequence.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        if (word1.empty()) return word2.size();
        if (word2.empty()) return word1.size();
        
        const int word1_size(word1.size()), word2_size(word2.size());
        
        // Record the length of longest common subsequence.
        vector< vector<int> > len_of_lcs(word1_size + 1, vector<int>(word2_size + 1, 0));
        
        for (int len1 = 0; len1 <= word1_size; ++len1) {
            for (int len2 = 0; len2 <= word2_size; ++len2) {
                if (len1 == 0 || len2 == 0) {
                    len_of_lcs[len1][len2] = 0;
                } else {
                    if (word1[len1 - 1] == word2[len2 - 1]) {
                        len_of_lcs[len1][len2] = 1 + len_of_lcs[len1 - 1][len2 - 1];
                    } else { // word1[len1 - 1] != word2[len2 - 1]
                        len_of_lcs[len1][len2] = std::max(len_of_lcs[len1][len2 - 1],
                                                          len_of_lcs[len1 - 1][len2]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        const int longest_lcs_len = len_of_lcs[word1_size][word2_size];
        return (word1_size - longest_lcs_len) + (word2_size - longest_lcs_len);
    }
};
```
