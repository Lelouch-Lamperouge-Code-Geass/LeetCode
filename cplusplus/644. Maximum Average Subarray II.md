Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to k that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation:
when length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,
when length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.
Thus return 12.75.
```

#### Note:

* 1 <= k <= n <= 10,000.
* Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000].
* The answer with the calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

# Solution

The most intuitive solution is to calculate range sum of the whole array. And for each index ```i```, calculate the range sum for ```[j, i]``` here ```0 <= j <= i - k```. 

__However, this solution will have TLE issue since its time complexity is O(N ^ 2).___

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        const std::size_t n = nums.size();
        std::vector<double> range_sum(n + 1, 0);
        
        for (std::size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            range_sum[i + 1] = range_sum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        double reval(INT_MIN);
        for (std::size_t i = k - 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (std::size_t j = 0; j + k <= i; ++j) {
                reval = std::max(reval, (range_sum[i] - range_sum[j]) / (i - j) );    
            }
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
};
```

In order to do better than this, we need to have solution with time complexity O(NlogN) or O(N). Obviously, its impossible to do better than O(N).

### Solution one

The idea is using the binary search to find the maximum average value. We know that the maximum average value must be between the minimal value (left in the code ) and maximum value (right in the code ) in nums. Each time we can check if ```mid = (left+right)/2``` is larger or less than the the maximum average value:

We use ```max_ave``` to denote the maximum average value. Then, for any i, j, ```(j-i>=k-1)```, we can have ```(nums[i] - max_ave) + (nums[i+1] - max_ave)+...+ (nums[j] - max_ave) <= 0```. Therefore, for some ```i, j (j-i>=k-1)```, if we find ```(nums[i] - mid) + (nums[i+1] - mid)+...+ (nums[j] - mid) > 0```, then ```mid``` must be smaller than ```max_ave```. The code is as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    //Check whether we can find a subarray whose average is bigger than parameter "average".
    // Thus, for each number in nums, we minus "average", and if we can find subarray's sum is
    // possitive, then it means that "average" is smaller than the maximum average value.
    bool hasSubarrayWithLargerAverage(vector<int>& nums, double average, int subarray_min_size){
        // sum: the sum from nums[0] to nums[i], with each number minus average.
        // prev_sum:  the sum from nums[0] to nums[i-k], with each number minus average.
        // min_sum: the minimal sum from nums[0] to nums[j] ( 0=< j  <= i-k ), with each number minus average.
        double sum = 0, prev_sum = 0, min_sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            sum += nums[i] - average;
            if(i >= subarray_min_size){
                prev_sum += nums[i - subarray_min_size] - average;                        
                min_sum = min(min_sum, prev_sum); 
            }
            if(i >= subarray_min_size - 1 && sum > min_sum) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;                                               
    }
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        static double ELIPSON(0.00001);
        double left = *std::min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        double right = *std::max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        double mid(0);
        
        while(left + ELIPSON < right){
            mid = left + (right - left)/2;
            if(hasSubarrayWithLargerAverage(nums, mid, k)) left = mid;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
