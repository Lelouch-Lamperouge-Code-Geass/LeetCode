Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
Given n = 13,
Return 6, because digit 1 occurred in the following numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.

# Solution

Go through the digit positions one at a time, find out how often a “1” appears at each position, and sum those up.

Go through the digit positions by using position multiplier unit with values 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.

For each position, split the decimal representation into two parts, for example split ```n = 3141592``` into ```left = 31415``` and ```right = 92``` when we’re at ```unit = 100``` for analyzing the hundreds-digit. And then we know that the hundreds-digit of n is 1 for prefixes "" to "3141", i.e., 3142 times. Each of those times is a streak, though. Because it’s the hundreds-digit, each streak is 100 long. So (left / 10 + 1) * 100 times, the hundreds-digit is 1.

Consider the thousands-digit, i.e., when ```unit = 1000```. Then ```left = 3141``` and ```right = 592```. The thousands-digit is 1 for prefixes "" to ""314", so 315 times. And each time is a streak of 1000 numbers. However, since the thousands-digit is a 1, the very last streak isn’t 1000 numbers but only 593 numbers, for the suffixes "000" to "592". So ```(left / 10 * 1000) + (right + 1)``` times, the thousands-digit is 1.

The case distincton between the current digit/position being 0, 1 and >=2 can easily be done in one expression. With ```(left + 8) / 10``` you get the number of full streaks, and a % 10 == 1 tells you whether to add a partial streak.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDigitOne(int n) {
        int reval(0);
        for(long long unit = 1; unit <= n; unit *= 10){ //unit could be 1,10,100,1000...
            int left(n / unit),right(n % unit);//3141592 => 3141 and 592
            if(left % 10 > 1) reval += (left/10 + 1) * unit;
            if(left % 10 == 1) reval += (left/10) *unit + (right + 1);
            if(left % 10 == 0) reval += (left/10) *unit;
        }
        return reval;
    }
};
```
