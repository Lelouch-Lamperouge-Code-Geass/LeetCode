Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

Examples: 
[2,3,4] , the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
For example:

```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
```

# Solution

__Official solution__: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/solution/

* keep two heaps (or priority queues):  
  * Max-heap small has the smaller half of the numbers.  
  * Min-heap large has the larger half of the numbers.  
  
This gives me direct access to the one or two middle values (they're the tops of the heaps), so getting the median takes O(1) time. And adding a number takes O(log n) time.

Supporting both min- and max-heap is more or less cumbersome, depending on the language, so I simply negate the numbers in the heap in which I want the reverse of the default order. To prevent this from causing a bug with -231 (which negated is itself, when using 32-bit ints), I use integer types larger than 32 bits.

Using larger integer types also prevents an overflow error when taking the mean of the two middle numbers. I think almost all solutions posted previously have that bug.

```cpp
class MedianFinder {
 public:
  // Adds a number into the data structure.
 // The keypoint here is that in order to make the numbers in both heap
 // are sorted, we need to push the number into one heap and the put the
 // top item of that heap to another heap.
 // In short:
 // (1) the values in heap are sorted across the two heap, 
 //     the maximum number of left heap can't be larger than the smallest number 
 //     of the right heap. Vice versaã€‚
 // (2) The size of left heap is equal or one larger than the size of right heap.
  void addNum(int num) {
    if (max_heap.size() > min_heap.size()) {  // add one item on min_heap
      max_heap.push(num);
      min_heap.push(max_heap.top());
      max_heap.pop();
    } else {  // add one item on max_heap
      min_heap.push(num);
      max_heap.push(min_heap.top());
      min_heap.pop();
    }
  }

  // Returns the median of current data stream
  double findMedian() {
    return max_heap.size() != min_heap.size()
               ? max_heap.top()
               : max_heap.top() + (min_heap.top() - max_heap.top()) / 2.0;
  }

 private:
  std::priority_queue<int, vector<int>, std::greater<int> > min_heap;
  std::priority_queue<int, vector<int>, std::less<int> > max_heap;
};

// Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
// MedianFinder mf;
// mf.addNum(1);
// mf.findMedian();
int main() {
  string str("1,8,3,5,4,2,6,7,9");
  std::istringstream iss(str);
  MedianFinder mf;

  while (std::getline(iss, str, ',')) {
    mf.addNum(std::stoi(str));
  }
  double val = mf.findMedian();
  return 0;
}
```
