This is a follow up of [Shortest Word Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/). The only difference is now word1 could be the same as word2.

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

For example,  
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1.  
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3.  

##### __Note__:

You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.

# Solution

The tricky part is how to handle that case that word1 and word2 are the same?

Imagine you have a words list ["a", "a", "a", "a"] and word1 == "a", word2 == "a", how are you going handle this case?

We just need to make sure pos1 always smaller than pos2(or you can make it always bigger than pos2 if you like).

All we need to do is, for each index, we assign it to pos1 first, and then swap pos1 with pos2.

Note that in below solution, if word1 and word2 are the same, the "else if" clause will never get executed.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
   int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
      long long dist = INT_MAX, i1 = dist, i2 = -dist;
      bool same = (word1 == word2);
      for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
          if (words[i] == word1) {
              i1 = i;
              if (same) {
                 // The swap here makes i1 always smaller than i2 when
                 // word1 == word2. 
                 swap(i1, i2);
              }
          } else if (words[i] == word2) {
              i2 = i;
          }
          dist = min(dist, abs(i1 - i2));
      }
      return dist;
  }
};
```
