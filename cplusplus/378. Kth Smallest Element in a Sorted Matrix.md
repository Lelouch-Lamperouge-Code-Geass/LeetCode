Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
 
 
Example:

matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,

return 13.
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n2.
 
# Solution
 
### Solution one 

Use a heap.
 
Here is the step of my solution:

1. Build a minHeap of elements from the first row.
2. Do the following operations k-1 times : Every time when you poll out the root(Top Element in Heap), you need to know the row number and column number of that element(so we can create a tuple class here), replace that root with the next element from the same column.
 
After you finish this problem, thinks more :

* For this question, you can also build a min Heap from the first column, and do the similar operations as above.(Replace the root with the next element from the same row)
* What is more, this problem is exact the same with Leetcode373 Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums, I use the same code which beats 96.42%, after you solve this problem, you can check with this link:
https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/52953/share-my-solution-which-beat-96-42

```cpp 
class Solution {
public:
  struct Item {
    Item(int val,std::size_t row,std::size_t col)
      : m_val(val),m_row(row), m_col(col) {}
    int m_val;
    std::size_t m_row;
    std::size_t m_col;
  };

  struct ItemCompare {
    bool operator()(const Item & left, const Item & right){
      return left.m_val>right.m_val;
    }
  };

  int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
    const std::size_t row_size(matrix.size()), col_size(matrix[0].size());
    std::priority_queue<Item,std::vector<Item>, ItemCompare > min_heap;
    for (std::size_t i=0;i<col_size;++i) {
      min_heap.push(Item(matrix[0][i],0,i));
    }

    for (int i = 1;i < k; ++i) {
      const std::size_t cur_row = min_heap.top().m_row,
        cur_col = min_heap.top().m_col;
      min_heap.pop();
      if (cur_row + 1 == row_size) continue;
      min_heap.push(Item(matrix[cur_row+1][cur_col],cur_row+1,cur_col));
    }
    return min_heap.top().m_val;
  }
};
```

### Solution two

We are done here, but let’s think about this problem in another way:

The key point for any binary search is to figure out the “Search Space”. For me, I think there are two kind of “Search Space” – index and range(the range from the smallest number to the biggest number). Most usually, when the array is sorted in one direction, we can use index as “search space”, when the array is unsorted and we are going to find a specific number, we can use “range”.
 
Let me give you two examples of these two “search space”

* index – A bunch of examples – https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/ ( the array is sorted)
* range – https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/ (Unsorted Array)

The reason why we did not use index as “search space” for this problem is the matrix is sorted in two directions, we can not find a linear way to map the number and its index.

这个题目还可以用二分查找来解决,思路是:
二维数组中左上角的肯定是最小值,右下角的肯定是最大值,我们取他们的平均值,
然后计算小于等于平均值的数字的个数,如果个数是小于题目要求的,那么说明要求的值是要大于平均值的,
此时我们更新start的值;如果个数是不小于题目要求的,那么说明要求的值就在start和mid之间,此时更新end的值。
The time complexity is ```O(n * log(n) * log(N))```, where ```n``` is the number of rows and  ```N``` is the search space that ranges from the smallest element to the biggest element.
You can argue that int implies ```N = 2^32```, so ```log(N)``` is constant. I guess this is ```where O(n * log(n))``` comes from.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
    std::size_t n = matrix.size();
    int low(matrix[0][0]), high(matrix[n-1][n-1]);
    while (low < high) {
      int mid = low + ((high - low) >> 1) ;
      int count = 0;
      for (std::size_t row=0; row < n; ++row) {
        std::size_t pos = std::upper_bound(matrix[row].begin(),
                                           matrix[row].end(), mid) - matrix[row].begin();
        count += pos;
      }

      if (count < k) {
        low = mid + 1;
      } else {
        high = mid;
      }
    }
    return low;
  }
};
```
