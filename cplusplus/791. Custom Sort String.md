S and T are strings composed of lowercase letters. In S, no letter occurs more than once.

S was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of T so that they match the order that S was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in S, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

Return any permutation of T (as a string) that satisfies this property.

#### Example :

```
Input: 
S = "cba"
T = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: 
"a", "b", "c" appear in S, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a". 
Since "d" does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
```
 

#### Note:

* S has length at most 26, and no character is repeated in S.
* T has length at most 200.
* S and T consist of lowercase letters only.

# Solution

The idea is simple. We assign a weight for each char in S. Char with higher weight should be put before char with lower weight.

Since this problem only contains lowercase chars, we can use vector<int> to store the relationship from char to its weight.

Then we use 26 string buckets to assign char in T to its related bucket. For example, if char ‘t’ has weight 23, then it should be appended to char_buckets[23].

Eventually, we output string in buckets from higher weight to lower weight.

```
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string S, string T) {
        vector<int> weight(26, 0);
        int cur_weight(25);
        for (char c : S) {
            weight[c - 'a'] = cur_weight--;
        }
        
        vector<string> char_buckets(26, "");
        
        for (char c : T) {
            char_buckets[weight[c - 'a']].push_back(c);
        }
        
        ostringstream oss;
        for (int weight = 25; weight >= 0; --weight) {
            oss << char_buckets[weight];
        }
        
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```
