Remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.

Note: The input string may contain letters other than the parentheses ( and ).
  
Examples:

```
"()())()" -> ["()()()", "(())()"]
"(a)())()" -> ["(a)()()", "(a())()"]
")(" -> [""] 
```

# Solution


### Solution one
We all know how to check a string of parentheses is valid using a stack. Or even simpler use a counter.
The counter will increase when it is '(' and decrease when it is ')'. Whenever the counter is negative, we have more ')' than '(' in the prefix.

To make the prefix valid, we need to remove a ')'. The problem is: which one? The answer is any one in the prefix. However, if we remove any one, we will generate duplicate results, for example: s = ()), we can remove s[1] or s[2] but the result is the same (). Thus, __we restrict ourself to remove the first ```)``` in a series of concecutive ```)```s__.

After the removal, the prefix is then valid. We then call the function recursively to solve the rest of the string. However, we need to keep another information: the last removal position. If we do not have this position, we will generate duplicate by removing two ')' in two steps only with a different order.

For this, we keep tracking the last removal position and only remove ```)``` after that.

Now one may ask. What about ```(```? What if s = ```"(()(()"``` in which we need remove ```(```?
The answer is: do the same from right to left.
However a cleverer idea is: reverse the string and reuse the code!


For example,

Let's say after we remove invalid ```)``` from left to right, now we have more(or not less) ```(``` than ```)```.

If what we got is ```(()(()```, we should reverse it to ```)(()((```, and now we should treat ```)``` as the open parenthesis, ```(``` as the close parenthesis, and remove invalid ```(```. After this clean-up, we just reverse the string back and add it to final result.


What's the purpose of ```last_remove_pos```? Let us review the algorithm. We scan ths string s from left to right, and whenever we neet an extra close-parenthese, we know we need to delete one. Here we need to be careful that after the one deletion, the generated strings should be unique. And then we keep calling the same function again with this  unique and different "new string s". If we regard the original string s as a tree node, here we get different children with different prefixes. For these children, we need to do the same, scan them until meet extra close-parenthese, and process them to generate new "longer prefix  string". Basically, each of these children nodes will have their own children with just "longer prefix string". Because these prefix substrings are valid, so we can just begin to scan the new strings from the last-valid-len becuase the prefix ```s.substr(0, last_valid_len)``` is valid. __In fact, that's the only purpose of ```last_valid_len``` here, to avoid checking the already valid prefix. The algorithm still works even when we remove this parameter and scan from index 0 every time. The critical parameter here is ```last_remove_pos``, which is to mark the profress of delete close parenthese.__

The most tricky question is, after we meet the extra close-parenthese, should we try to delete begin from which index? Should we begin to delete from index 0, or should we begin to delete from ```last_valid_len```? The answer is neither.

If we begin to delete from ```last_valid_len```, then ```())())``` after first function call will have one child ```()())``` with ```last_valid_len == 2```, we will never have ```(())``` if we can only delete ')' from index 2. So this is wrong. 

If we begin to delete from index 0, for original string s "()()))", we will have two children:

1. ```(()))``` with ```last_valid_len = 4, last_remove_pos = 1```.
2. ```()())``` with ```last_valid_len = 4, last_remove_pos = 4```.

If we scan from index 0 again, both will have child ```(())```. This will generated duplicate results.

Therefore, we should begin to delete extra close-parenthese from ```last_remove_pos```.

#### Keynote with this algorithm

Whenever we call ```removeInvalidParenthesesWithDFS```, we basically enter a tree node. And we can think that when enter this tree node,  ```s``` is consist of ```s[0, k]``` which is a valid prefix part, and ```s[k + 1, end]``` which is the part that has not been processed. Whenever we meet a conflix closed parentheses, that means we need to cut one closed parenthese off and go to visit one of current tree-node's children. In order to avoid duplicates, we need to make sure that the prefix of every tree node in this tree is unique. 

To make sure the prefix of every tree node is unique, or you can say to make sure every tree node has an unique child,  we have these restricts:

1. Remove the first ```)``` in a series of concecutive ```)```
2. When we delete ```)```, we don't go back before the position of last removed close parenthese. 

You can say that each tree node can only have child("give birth" =] ) on closed parentheses. Each child node is the same problem as parent node but with a longer valid prefix of ```s```.

__```last_remove_pos``` is used to mark the progress of deleting conflict closed parentheses.__ 

A leaf node is when ```s``` has no conflict closed parenthese, thus it won't have children.

                    // Therefore, for consecutive )) we only remove the first one.
                    for (int j = last_remove_pos; j <= i; ++j) {
                        if (s[j] == parentheses.second 
                            && (j == last_remove_pos || s[j - 1] != parentheses.second)) {

### Solution two

As long as we know how many invalid left parentheses and how many invalid right parentheses then this problem
becomes quite similar to LeetCode-22(generate parentheses). Our primary job is to guarantee the generated string is valid.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
        const std::pair<std::size_t, std::size_t> &invalid_count = get_invalid_count(s);
        std::unordered_set<string> reval; // use hashset to remove duplicate
        string temp("");
        removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, 0, 0, invalid_count.first, invalid_count.second);
        return std::vector<std::string>(reval.begin(), reval.end());
    }
    
    
private:
    // return pair <invalid_left, invalid_right>
    std::pair<std::size_t, std::size_t> get_invalid_count(const std::string &s) {
        std::vector<char> parenthesis;
        std::size_t invalid_left(0), invalid_right(0);
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                ++ invalid_left;
            }
            
            if (c == ')') {
                if (invalid_left > 0) -- invalid_left;
                else ++ invalid_right;
            }
        }
        
        return std::make_pair(invalid_left, invalid_right);
    }
    
    void removeWithDFS(std::unordered_set<string> &reval, 
                       string &temp, 
                       const std::string &s,
                       std::size_t pos,
                       std::size_t open_pair,
                       std::size_t invalid_left, 
                       std::size_t invalid_right ) {
        if (pos == s.size()) {
            if (invalid_left == 0 && invalid_right == 0 && open_pair == 0) {
                reval.insert(temp);
            }
        } else if (s[pos]!='(' && s[pos]!=')'){
            temp.push_back(s[pos]);
            removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, pos + 1, open_pair, invalid_left, invalid_right);
            temp.pop_back();
        } else {
            if (s[pos] == '(') {
                // keep this '('
                temp.push_back('(');
                removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, pos + 1, open_pair + 1, invalid_left, invalid_right);
                temp.pop_back();
                
                // ignore this '('
                if (invalid_left > 0) {
                    removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, pos + 1, open_pair, invalid_left - 1, invalid_right);
                }
            } else  { // s[pos] == ')'
                // keep this ')'
                if (open_pair > 0) { // we need make sure have open (
                    temp.push_back(')');
                    removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, pos + 1, open_pair - 1, invalid_left, invalid_right);
                    temp.pop_back();
                }
                
                // ignore this ')'
                if (invalid_right > 0) {
                    removeWithDFS(reval, temp, s, pos + 1, open_pair, invalid_left, invalid_right - 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
