Given two strings representing two [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
```

Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.

##### Example 2:

```
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
```

Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

##### Note:

* The input strings will not have extra blank.
* The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.

### Solution one

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    pair<int, int> getExpression(const string &str) {
        pair<int, int> reval;
        
        std::size_t sign_pos = str.find_first_of("+");
        reval.first = std::stoi(str.substr(0, sign_pos));
        
        string imaginary_str = str.substr(sign_pos + 1);
        imaginary_str.pop_back();
        reval.second = std::stoi(imaginary_str);
        return reval;
    }
public:
    string complexNumberMultiply(string a, string b) {
        pair<int, int> a_exp = getExpression(a);
        pair<int, int> b_exp = getExpression(b);
        int real_part = a_exp.first * b_exp.first + (-a_exp.second * b_exp.second);
        int imaginary_part = a_exp.first * b_exp.second + a_exp.second * b_exp.first;
        ostringstream oss;
        oss << real_part << '+' << imaginary_part << 'i';
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```

### Solution two

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string complexNumberMultiply(string a, string b) {
        istringstream iss_of_a(a), iss_of_b(b);
        
        // ra, rb are the real number of a, b
        // ia, ib are the imaginary number of a, b
        int ra(0), rb(0), ia(0), ib(0);
        
        // buff is the char used to hold '+' char
        char buff;
        
        iss_of_a >> ra >> buff >> ia;
        iss_of_b >> rb >> buff >> ib;
        
        ostringstream oss;
        oss << (ra * rb - ia * ib) << '+' << (ra * ib + ia * rb) << 'i';
        
        return oss.str();
    }
};
```

### Complex number

A __complex number__ is a number that can be expressed in the form ```a + bi```, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x ^ 2 = âˆ’1, which is called an __imaginary number__ because there is no real number that satisfies this equation. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part. Despite the historical nomenclature "imaginary", complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as "real" as the real numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of our description of the natural world.
