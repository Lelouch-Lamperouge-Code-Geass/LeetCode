Implement a ```MyCalendarTwo``` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

Your class will have one method, ```book(int start, int end)```. Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval ```[start, end)```, the range of real numbers x such that ```start <= x < end```.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)

For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)

#### Example 1:
```
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first two events can be booked.  
The third event can be double booked.
The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, 
  because it would result in a triple booking.
The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, 
  as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, 
  as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event;
the time [40, 50) will be single booked, 
  and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.
```

#### Note:

* The number of calls to ```MyCalendar.book``` per test case will be at most 1000.
* In calls to ```MyCalendar.book(start, end)```, ```start``` and ```end``` are integers in the range [0, 10^9].

# Solution

The big idea is pretty simple: Each time of book, instead of fail a book when there is 1 or more overlap with existing books as in MyCalendar I, we just want to make sure these overlaps does not overlap - having overlap is now ok, but overlapped period cannot be overlapped again.

So we just need to keep track of all the overlaps with any previous books

```cpp
class MyCalendarTwo {
private:
    vector<pair<int, int>> m_booking;
    vector<pair<int, int>> m_overlapped;
    
public:
    MyCalendarTwo() {
        
    }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (const pair<int, int> &item : m_booking) {
            int overlap_start = std::max(item.first, start) ;
            int overlap_end = std::min(item.second, end);
            if (overlap_start < overlap_end) {
                for (const pair<int, int> &overlap_item : m_overlapped) {
                    if (std::max(overlap_item.first, overlap_start) 
                        < std::min(overlap_item.second, overlap_end)) {
                        // We do not need to keep the overlaps of previous book() calls, 
                        // because the overlapped bookings will be stored in the booking list anyway. 
                        // We also need to clear the overlap list when we see a triple overlap 
                        // caused by a booking, because the previous overlaps caused by this 
                        // booking should be removed (the booking is not successful.)
                        m_overlapped.clear();
                        return false;
                    }
                }
                m_overlapped.push_back({overlap_start, overlap_end});
            }
        }
        m_booking.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyCalendarTwo object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendarTwo obj = new MyCalendarTwo();
 * bool param_1 = obj.book(start,end);
 */
 ```
