X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

#### Example:

```
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

#### Note:

* N  will be in range [1, 10000].

# Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    /*
     Valid if N contains ATLEAST ONE 2, 5, 6, 9
     AND NO 3, 4 or 7s
    */
    bool isValid(int number) {
        bool is_valid(false);
        while (number) {
            if (number % 10 == 3 
                || number % 10 == 4 
                || number % 10 == 7) {
                return false;
            } else if (number % 10 == 2 
                     || number % 10 == 5 
                     || number % 10 == 6
                     || number % 10 == 9) {
                is_valid = true;
            }
            number /= 10;
        }
        return is_valid;
    }
public:
    int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int count_of_good_number(0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            count_of_good_number += (isValid(i) ? 1 : 0);
        }
        
        return count_of_good_number;
    }
};
```
