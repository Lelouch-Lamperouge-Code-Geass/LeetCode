Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl/description/).
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

# Solution

Note that the code here below is more like a concept-proving code.

In practice, you need use very good hash function and a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt) value.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<string, string> m_url_mapper;
    string getHash(const string &str) {
        static int i(0);
        return std::to_string(i++);
    }
public:

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    string encode(string longUrl) {
        string shortUrl = "http://tinyurl.com/" + getHash(longUrl);
        m_url_mapper[shortUrl] =  longUrl;
        return shortUrl;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    string decode(string shortUrl) {
        return m_url_mapper[shortUrl];
    }
};
```
