On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
```

##### Note:

* cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
* Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

# Solution

If we know the minimum cost on each index, then our final result will be depended on ```min_cost[n - 2]``` and ```min_cost[n - 1]```.

Right now the answer of original problem "get minimum cost to reach the top" is depened on the answer of "how to calculate the minimum cost on each index". 

And the minimum cost on any index i can be calculated by 

```
min_cost[i] = cost[i] + min(min_cost[i - 2], min_cost[i - 1])
```

Here we succefully break the original problem down into a collection of simpler and similar subproblems.

This is a typical dynamic programming problem.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        // We can start either on index 0 or 1.
        // These two variables represent the minimum cost
        // one step or two steps before.
        int pre2(cost[0]), pre1(cost[1]);
        for (int i = 2; i < cost.size(); ++i) {
            int cur_min = cost[i] + std::min(pre1, pre2);
            
            pre2 = pre1;
            pre1 = cur_min;
        }
        return std::min(pre1, pre2);
    }
};
```
