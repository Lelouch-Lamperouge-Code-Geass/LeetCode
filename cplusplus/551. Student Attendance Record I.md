You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

* 'A' : Absent.
* 'L' : Late.
* 'P' : Present.

A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False
```

# Solution

This problem is quite simple. The only trap here is that 'A' can interrupt continuous 'L' as well. For example, ""LLALL"" wil still return true.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkRecord(string s) {
        size_t num_of_absent(0), late_momentum(0);
        for (size_t i = 0, n = s.size(); i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == 'L') {
                if (++ late_momentum == 3) return false;
            } else {
                if (s[i] == 'A') {
                    if (++ num_of_absent == 2) return false;
                }
                late_momentum = 0;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
