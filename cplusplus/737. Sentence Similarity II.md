Given two sentences ```words1, words2``` (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, ```words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"]``` and ```words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"]``` are similar, if the similar word pairs are ```pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]```.

Note that the __similarity relation is transitive__. For example, if "great" and "good" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, then "great" and "fine" are similar.

__Similarity is also symmetric__. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences ```words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] ```are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like ```words1 = ["great"]``` can never be similar to ```words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]```.

#### Note:

* The length of ```words1``` and ```words2``` will not exceed 1000.
* The length of ```pairs``` will not exceed 2000.
* The length of each ```pairs[i]``` will be 2.
* The length of each ```words[i]``` and ```pairs[i][j]``` will be in the range ```[1, 20]```.

# Solution

* This is a good use case for __Union-Find__, compare to Sentence Similarity I, here the similarity between words are transitive, so all the connected(similar) words should be group into an _union_ represented by their _ultimate parent_(or family holder, you name it).  
* The connections can be represented by an parent map Map<String, String> m, which record the direct parent-ship we learned in each pair, but not the ultimate-parent. To build it, go through the input pairs, for each pair<w1, w2>, use the recursive find() method to find the ultimate-parent for both word - parent1, parent2, if they are different, assign parent1 as parent of parent2(or the other way around), so that the to families are merged.  
* The classic find(x) method will find the ultimate-parent of x. I modified it a little bit, make it do a little of extra initialization work - assign x itself as its parent when it is not initialize - so that we donâ€™t have to explicitly initialize the map at the beginning.

        while (union_parents[item] != item) {
            item = union_parents[item] = union_parents[union_parents[item]];

        // Similar sentence must have same number of words!

        for (size_t n = words1.size(), i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            string from(findUnionRoot(words1[i], union_parents));
            string to(findUnionRoot(words2[i], union_parents));
