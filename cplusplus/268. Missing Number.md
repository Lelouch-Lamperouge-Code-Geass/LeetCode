Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
  
##### Example 1

```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```  

##### Example 2

```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

##### Note:

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?  

# Solution
 
### Solution 1
  
The basic idea is to use XOR operation. We all know that a^b^b =a, which means two xor operations with the same number will eliminate the number and reveal the original number.  
  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  // n distinct numbers gave the hint.
  // won't work if not distince
  int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    const int n(nums.size());
    int reval(0);
    for (int i=0;i<n;++i) {
      reval ^= nums[i];
      reval ^= i;
    }
    reval ^= n;
    return reval;
  }
};
```

### Solution 2

This solution is not as good as above one, while it still pass the Leetcode unit tests.
  
The main issue is that the sum may overflow when nums is big.  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        long n = nums.size();
        
        long sum = (0 + n) * (n + 1)/ 2;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum -= num;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
