Can you solve it without using extra space?  

# Solution
  
```cpp  
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
  ListNode *slow(head),*fast(head);
  while (fast && fast->next) {
    fast = fast->next->next;
    slow = slow->next;
    if (slow == fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

### Cycle detection

In computer science, __cycle detection__ or __cycle finding__ is the algorithmic problem of finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.

For any function f that maps a finite set ```S``` to itself, and any initial value ```x0``` in ```S```, the sequence of iterated function values 

x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub>), x<sub>2</sub> = f(x<sub>1</sub>), .... x<sub>i</sub> = f(x<sub>i-1</sub>)....

must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some pair of distinct indices i and j such that xi = xj. Once this happens, the sequence must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence of values from x<sub>i</sub> to x<sub>j</sub> âˆ’ 1. Cycle detection is the problem of finding i and j, given ```f``` and x<sub>0</sub>.

Several algorithms for finding cycles quickly and with little memory are known. Floyd's tortoise and the hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values. Alternatively, Brent's algorithm is based on the idea of exponential search. Both Floyd's and Brent's algorithms use only a constant number of memory cells, and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance from the start of the sequence to the first repetition. Several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations.

#### Floyd's Tortoise and Hare

Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds. It is also called the __"tortoise and the hare algorithm"__, alluding to Aesop's fable of The Tortoise and the Hare.
