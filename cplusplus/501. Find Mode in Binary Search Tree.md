Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:

```
Given BST [1,null,2,2],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
return [2].
```

__Note__: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

__Follow up__: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

# Solution

### Solution one

Assume the return value and implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count, this solution does not use any extra space.

We use ```cur_val``` and ```cur_freq``` to store current value and its frequency. 

For each node:

1. If its value is different from ```cur_val```, we set its value to be ```cur_val```, and set ```cur_freq``` to be 1.
2. If its value is the same as ```cur_val```, just increase ```cur_freq```

And we also need to compare ```cur_freq``` with ```max_freq``` on each node:

1. If ```cur_freq > max_freq``` :  This is the maximum frequency we have ever met, and we can discard all previous max-frequency nodes in ```reval```. An interesting thing here is that we may discard and push the same value into ```reval``` again and again. For example, "1,2,2,2,2", here we clear ```reval``` and push "2" into it again and again.
2. If ```cur_freq == max_freq``` : We have met values with same max-frequency before.
3. If ```cur_freq == max_freq``` : No action needed.

class Solution {

    // For each node, if its value is
    // not the same as cur_val, we know we just
    // meet a new value. Reset cur_val and cur_freq.
    // Otherwise just increase cur_freq.
    // If cur_freq is bigger than max_freq, clear
    // reval. If it is the same as max_freq, add it
    // to reval.

                     vector<int> &reval) {
        if (cur_val != root->val) {
            cur_val = root->val;
            cur_freq = 1;
        } else {
            ++ cur_freq;
        }

        if (cur_freq > max_freq) {
            max_freq = cur_freq;
            reval.clear();
            reval.emplace_back(cur_val);
        } else if (cur_freq == max_freq) {
            reval.emplace_back(cur_val);
        }
    }

    void getNodesWithMaxFrequency(TreeNode *root, 
                                  int &cur_val,
                                  int &cur_freq,
                                  int &max_freq,
                                  vector<int> &reval) {
        if (root) {
            getNodesWithMaxFrequency(root->left, cur_val, cur_freq, max_freq, reval);
            processNode(root, cur_val, cur_freq, max_freq, reval);
            getNodesWithMaxFrequency(root->right, cur_val, cur_freq, max_freq, reval);
        }
    }
public:
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {

        getNodesWithMaxFrequency(root, cur_val, cur_freq, max_freq,  reval);
        return reval;
    }
};
```

### Solution two

This is the real O(1) space complexity solution using Morris-traversal, does not counting the return value.
Because if the tree only contains unique nodes, then the return value will store the values of the whole tree.
So it is impossible to get O(1) space complexity in worst case if we are counting the space used by return value.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
