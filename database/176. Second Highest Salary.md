Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

# Solution

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
Employee
WHERE Employee.Salary < (
    SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
)
```

# Knowledge

A __subquery__ is a query contained within another query. Subqueries are _surrounded by parentheses_ and can be found in various parts of a select statement; within the from clause, however, a subquery serves the role of generating a __temporary table__ that is visible from all other query clauses and can interact with other tables named in the from clause.
