##### Table: Person

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

PersonId is the primary key column for this table.

##### Table: Address

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

AddressId is the primary key column for this table.

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

```
FirstName, LastName, City, State
```

# Solution

INNER JOIN only returns records that are in BOTH tables. That means for a person who does not have an address record in the Address Table will not be displayed in your solution using INNER JOIN. Remember in the question it mentioned “regardless if there is an address for each of those people”.



```sql
SELECT 
Person.FirstName, 
Person.LastName, 
Address.City, 
Address.State 
FROM Person LEFT OUTER JOIN Address 
  ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
```
