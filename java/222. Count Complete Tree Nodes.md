Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):

In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

# Solution

Depth and height as properties of a node:

* The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node. A root node will have a depth of 0.  
* The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. A leaf node will have a height of 0.  

Properties of a tree:

* The height of a tree would be the height of its root node, or equivalently, the depth of its deepest node.
* Note that depth doesn't make sense for a tree.

                                                     
### Solution 1

Since this is a complete binary tree, for any tree node, if its left child tree's height is bigger than the right child tree, then the left child tree is a perferct binary tree. For a perferct binary tree with height H, its total nodes is ```2 ^ (height_of_left_tree + 1) - 1```, we can add the total nodes of left child tree plus current node, which is ```2 ^ height_of_left_tree```, and the move current node pointer to its right child.

If current node's left child tree's height is the same as right child tree, then its right child tree is a perferct binary tree. We can do the same thing like above, collecting the nodes of right tree plus current node.

Finding a height costs O(log(n)) and we need to do that O(log(n)) times. So overall time complexity is __O(log(n)^2)__.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        while (root != null) {
            int leftTreeDepth = getDepthOfCompleteBinaryTree(root.left);
            int rightTreeDepth = getDepthOfCompleteBinaryTree(root.right);;
            
            if (leftTreeDepth == rightTreeDepth) { // left tree is perfect binary tree
                count += 1 << (leftTreeDepth + 1);
                root = root.right;
            } else { // right tree is perfect binary tree
                count += 1 << (rightTreeDepth + 1);
                root = root.left;
            }
        }
       
        return count;
    }
    
    // Since we know it is a complete binary tree,
    // the depth of a node as a root is simply the distance 
    // to its leftmost leaf node.
    // Return -1 if root is null.
    private int getDepthOfCompleteBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return -1;
        int depth = 0;
        while (root.left != null) {
            root = root.left;
            ++ depth;
        }
        
        return depth;
    }
}
```
