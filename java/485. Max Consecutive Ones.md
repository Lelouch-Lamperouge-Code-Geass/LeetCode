Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

__Note:__

* The input array will only contain 0 and 1.  
* The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000  

# Solution

The idea is to reset `oneCounter` to 0 if we see 0, otherwise increase `oneCounter` by 1.

On each number, we check `oneCounter` with `reval`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int oneCounter = 0, reval = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                ++ oneCounter;
            } else {
                oneCounter = 0;
            }
            reval = Math.max(reval, oneCounter);
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
}
```
