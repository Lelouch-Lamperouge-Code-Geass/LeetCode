Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

__Note:__

* The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.  
* The given num does not contain any leading zero.  

__Example 1:__

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the 
new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```
__Example 2:__

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. 
Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

# Solution

Let's think about the simplest case: how to remove 1 digit from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible？ Well, one can simply scan from left to right, and remove the first "peak" digit; the peak digit is larger than its right neighbor. If we need to remove `k` digits, then we can repeat this procedure `k` times.

The above algorithm is a bit inefficient because it frequently remove a particular element from a string and has complexity `O(k * StringLength)`.

One can simulate the above procedure by using a stack, and obtain a `O(StringLength)` algorithm. Note, when the result stack (i.e. res) pop a digit, it is equivalent as remove that "peak" digit.

This is a greey algorithm. We make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeKdigits(String num, int k) {
        if (num == null || k == num.length()) return "0";
        
        ArrayDeque<Character> arrayDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (char c : num.toCharArray()) {
            while (k > 0 && !arrayDeque.isEmpty() && arrayDeque.peekLast() > c) {
                arrayDeque.pollLast();
                -- k;
            }
            arrayDeque.addLast(c);
        }
        
        // corner case like "1111"
        while(k>0){
            arrayDeque.pollLast();
            k--;            
        }
        
        // trim leading zeros
        while (!arrayDeque.isEmpty() && arrayDeque.peekFirst() == '0') {
            arrayDeque.pollFirst();
        }

        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : arrayDeque) {
            stringBuilder.append(c);
        }
        
        String reval = stringBuilder.toString();
        return reval.isEmpty() ? "0" : reval;
    }
}
```
