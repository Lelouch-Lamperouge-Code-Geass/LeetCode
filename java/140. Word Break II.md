Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences.

Note:

* The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
* You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:

```
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]
Output:
[
  "pine apple pen apple",
  "pineapple pen apple",
  "pine applepen apple"
]
```

Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

```
Input:
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output:
[]
```

# Solution

The most intuitive solution for this problem is using backtracking algorithm. If s.substr(pos, len) is a word, we can add it to the temporary vector, and keep looking forward with DFS. However, we will get TLE here.

How can we do better?

We know that one string can be broke into two parts, left part and right part. If the right part is a valid word, then we just need to get all the possible sentences from left part, and concatenate their combinations together. One corner case here is that the whole string is a valid word.

And to "get all the possible sentences from left part" is just a subproblem with smaller input.

In order to improve performance, we use memoization here to record each string and its possible sentences into a HashMap.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        HashSet<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>();
        wordSet.addAll(wordDict);
        HashMap<String, List<String>> memoizedResults = new HashMap<>();
        
        return wordBreak(s, wordSet, memoizedResults);
    }

    private List<String> wordBreak(String string,
                                   HashSet<String> wordSet,
                                   HashMap<String, List<String>> memoizedResults) {
        if (memoizedResults.containsKey(string)) return memoizedResults.get(string);
        List<String> reval = new ArrayList<>();
        if (wordSet.contains(string)) reval.add(string); // Check the whole string
        for (int len = 1; len < string.length(); ++len) {
            String leftString = string.substring(0, len);
            if (!wordSet.contains(leftString)) continue;
            List<String> rightPart = wordBreak(string.substring(len), wordSet, memoizedResults);
            if (rightPart.isEmpty()) continue;

            for (String rightPartStr : rightPart) {
                reval.add(leftString + ' ' + rightPartStr);
            }
        }

        memoizedResults.put(string, reval);
        return reval;
    }
}
```
