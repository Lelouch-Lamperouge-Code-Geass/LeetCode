Given a reference of a node in a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph) undirected graph, return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

Example:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png" width="600" height="600">

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

### Note:

* The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.  
* The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.  
* Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.  
* You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.  

# Solution


This problem is an application of graph traversal, which has two systematic methods: Bread-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

We need to maintain a hashmap from original node to the "clone" node. And use BFS or DFS to visit original nodes. Everytime we visit an original node, we need to create the "clone" node if it is null. And we also need to create the clone nodes for its neighbors and generate the clone edges from the cloned-original node to the clone neighbors.  

__Note: we also need be careful about cycle and self-cycle.__

### BFS

For each node, if its clone doesn't exist, that means we have not process this node before. Therefore we push it into BFS queue and also create its clone node. And when we pop a node out of BFS queue, we process its clone's edgesd.

In short, clone node before push original node into queue. Process the edges when pop original node out of the queue.

Time complexity  O(|V|+|E|), space complexity  O(|V|+|E|), since both vertices and edges are visited once.

```java
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        HashMap<Node, Node> nodeToClone = new HashMap<>(); // Used to track visited node
        nodeToClone.put(node, new Node());
        nodeToClone.get(node).val = node.val;
        queue.add(node); 
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Node curNode = queue.poll();
            List<Node> cloneNeighbors = new ArrayList<>();
            for (Node neighbor : curNode.neighbors) {
                if (!nodeToClone.containsKey(neighbor)) { // Means not visited
                    nodeToClone.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val, new ArrayList<>()));
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
                cloneNeighbors.add(nodeToClone.get(neighbor));
            }
            nodeToClone.get(curNode).neighbors = cloneNeighbors;
        }
        
        return nodeToClone.get(node);
    }
}
```

### DFS

Whenever we visit a graph node, instantiate the clone node and add it to the HahsMap to mark it as "visited".

Time complexity  O(|V|+|E|), space complexity  O(|V|+|E|).

```java
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        Map<Node, Node> nodeToCloneMap = new HashMap<>();
        dfsVisit(node, nodeToCloneMap);
        return nodeToCloneMap.get(node);
    }
    
    private void dfsVisit(Node originalNode, Map<Node, Node> nodeToCloneMap) {
        nodeToCloneMap.put(originalNode, new Node(originalNode.val, new ArrayList<>()));
                
        List<Node> cloneNeighbors = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Node neighbor : originalNode.neighbors) {
            if (!nodeToCloneMap.containsKey(neighbor)) {
                dfsVisit(neighbor, nodeToCloneMap);
            }
            nodeToCloneMap.get(originalNode).neighbors.add(nodeToCloneMap.get(neighbor));
        }
    }
}
```
