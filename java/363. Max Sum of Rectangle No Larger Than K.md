Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

__Example:__

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2,
             and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
```

__Note:__

* The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.  
* What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?  

# Solution

First of all, let's simplify this problem a little. What if it is not a matrix, but an array here?

The simpler problem is : Given a non-empty array and an integer k, find the max sum of a sub-array such that its sum is no larger than k.

Note that a subarray is not a sub-sequence.

To solve this, scan from left to right. Put the array[i] that you have encountered till now into a tree set. When you are processing array[i] what you need to retrieve from the set is the smallest number in the set such which is bigger than `sum - target`. This lookup can be done in `𝑂(logn)` using upper_bound. Hence the overall complexity is `𝑂(𝑛log(𝑛))`.

```java
public int maxSumSubarray(int[] array, int target) {
    TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
    treeSet.add(0); // important
    int sum = 0, reval = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
        sum += array[i];
        Integer ceiling = treeSet.ceiling(sum - target);
        if (ceiling != null) {
            reval = Math.max(reval, sum - ceiling);
        }
        treeSet.add(array[i]);
    }
    return reval;
}
```
