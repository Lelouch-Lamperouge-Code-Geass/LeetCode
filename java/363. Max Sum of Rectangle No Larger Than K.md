Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

__Example:__

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2,
             and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
```

__Note:__

* The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.  
* What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?  

# Solution

First of all, let's simplify this problem a little. What if it is not a matrix, but an array here?

The simpler problem is : Given a non-empty array and an integer k, find the max sum of a sub-array such that its sum is no larger than k.

To solve this, scan from left to right. Put the accumulated sum before index `i` into tree set. When you are processing `array[i]` what you need to retrieve from the set is the smallest number in the set such which is bigger than `sum - target`. This lookup can be done in `𝑂(logn)` using upper_bound. Hence the overall complexity is `𝑂(nlog(n))`.

__You may considered using rangeSum array here instead of putting accumulated sum in to a tree set. However, note that here negative number is allowed, so the values of rangeSum array doesn't always increase monotonically, and thus you are not able to do binary search on the rangeSum array.__


```java
public int maxSumSubarray(int[] array, int target) {
    TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
    treeSet.add(0); // important
    int sum = 0, reval = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
        sum += array[i];
        Integer ceiling = treeSet.ceiling(sum - target);
        if (ceiling != null) {
            reval = Math.max(reval, sum - ceiling);
        }
        treeSet.add(sum);
    }
    return reval;
}
```
    
Now we can solve this problem the same way, except now it is a 2-dimension array, matrix. The basic idea is to perform a dimension reduction, convert any rectangle to a 1-dimension array(either based on row or column).

```java
class Solution {

    public int maxSumSubmatrix(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int reval = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int fromRow = 0; fromRow < matrix.length; ++fromRow) {
            int[] sumOnCol= new int[matrix[0].length];
            for (int toRow = fromRow; toRow < matrix.length; ++toRow) {
                for (int col = 0; col < matrix[0].length; ++ col) {
                    sumOnCol[col] += matrix[toRow][col];
                }

                reval = Math.max(reval, maxSumSubarray(sumOnCol, k));
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
    
    public int maxSumSubarray(int[] array, int target) {
        TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add(0);
        int sum = 0, reval = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
            sum += array[i];
            Integer ceiling = treeSet.ceiling(sum - target);
            if (ceiling != null) {
                reval = Math.max(reval, sum - ceiling);
            }
            treeSet.add(sum);
        }
        return reval;
    }
}
```
