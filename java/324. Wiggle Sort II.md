Given an unsorted array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....`.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
Output: One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].
```

__Note:__  
You may assume all input has valid answer.

# Solution

Note: the difference between this and the wiggle sort I is that in this problem two adjacent number cannot be the same. And also wiggle sort I defines the wiggle style has to be `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3] ....`

For example, given nums = `[1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]`, `[1,1,1,2,2,3,2,3,3]` is an acceptable answer to wiggle sort I, but  not acceptable to wiggle sort II. A valid answer to wiggle sort II is `[1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]`.

### Solution 1

The idea is : we partition nums into small part and big part. And we add numbers from big part into odd indexes, and numbers from small part into even indexes. Note that for both part we need begin with their respective highest index, because the largest numbers in small part may be the same as the smallest numbers in big part.

```java
class Solution {
    public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
        findKthLargest(nums, (nums.length + 1) / 2);

        int smallIndex = nums.length / 2, bigIndex = 0;

        int[] clone = nums.clone();

        for (int i = 0; i < clone.length; ++i) {
            if ((i%2) == 0) {
                nums[i] = clone[smallIndex++];
            } else {
                nums[i] = clone[bigIndex++];
            }
        }
    }

    private int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
        -- k;
        int startIndex = 0, endIndex = nums.length - 1;
        while(startIndex <= endIndex) {
            int pivotIndex = getRandomPartition(nums, startIndex, endIndex);
            if (pivotIndex < k) {
                startIndex = pivotIndex + 1;
            } else if (pivotIndex > k) {
                endIndex = pivotIndex - 1;
            } else { // pivotIndex == k
                break;
            }
        }

        return nums[k];
    }

    private int getRandomPartition(int[] nums, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
        int randomIndex = new Random().nextInt(endIndex - startIndex + 1) + startIndex;
        final int pivot = nums[randomIndex];
        swap(nums, randomIndex, endIndex);
        int smallEnd = startIndex, smallBegin = startIndex - 1;

        while (smallEnd < endIndex) {
            if (nums[smallEnd] > pivot) {
                swap(nums, ++smallBegin, smallEnd++);
            } else {
                ++ smallEnd;
            }
        }

        swap(nums, ++smallBegin, endIndex);

        return smallBegin;
    }

    private void swap(final int[] nums, int index1, int index2) {
        int temp = nums[index1];
        nums[index1] = nums[index2];
        nums[index2] = temp;
    }

}
```

### Solution 2

The intuitive solution to this problem is to split numbers into a smaller half and a bigger half. And then get number from smaller array and bigger array alternately. How can we do better to get O(1) space complexity?Then we have to perform the reconstruction in-place.

First I find a median using nth_element. That only guarantees O(n) average time complexity and I don't know about space complexity. I might write this myself using O(n) time and O(1) space, but that's not what I want to show here.

This post is about what comes after that. We can use three-way partitioning to arrange the numbers so that those larger than the median come first, then those equal to the median come next, and then those smaller than the median come last.

Ordinarily, you'd then use one more phase to bring the numbers to their final positions to reach the overall wiggle-property. But I don't know a nice O(1) space way for this. Instead, I embed this right into the partitioning algorithm. That algorithm simply works with indexes 0 to n-1 as usual, but sneaky as I am, I rewire those indexes where I want the numbers to actually end up. The partitioning-algorithm doesn't even know that I'm doing that, it just works like normal (it just uses A(x) instead of nums[x]).

Let's say nums is `[10,11,...,19]`. Then after nth_element and ordinary partitioning, we might have this (15 is my median):

```
index:     0  1  2  3   4   5  6  7  8  9
number:   18 17 19 16  15  11 14 10 13 12
```

I rewire it so that the first spot has index 5, the second spot has index 0, etc, so that I might get this instead:
```
index:     5  0  6  1  7  2  8  3  9  4
number:   11 18 14 17 10 19 13 16 12 15
```

And `11 18 14 17 10 19 13 16 12 15` is perfectly wiggly. And the whole partitioning-to-wiggly-arrangement (everything after finding the median) only takes `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

So here is the index map:

```
0 => 1
1 => 3
2 => 5
3 => 7
4 => 9
5 => 0
6 => 2
7 => 4
8 => 6
9 => 8
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
        int median = findKthLargest(nums, (nums.length + 1) / 2);

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        int index = 0;

        while (index <= right) {

            if (nums[newIndex(index,nums.length)] > median) {
                swap(nums, newIndex(left++, nums.length), newIndex(index++, nums.length));
            }
            else if (nums[newIndex(index, nums.length)] < median) {
                swap(nums, newIndex(right--, nums.length), newIndex(index, nums.length));
            }
            else {
                ++index;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int newIndex(int index, int n) {
        return (1 + 2*index) % (n | 1);
    }

    private int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
        -- k;
        int startIndex = 0, endIndex = nums.length - 1;
        while(startIndex <= endIndex) {
            int pivotIndex = getRandomPartition(nums, startIndex, endIndex);
            if (pivotIndex < k) {
                startIndex = pivotIndex + 1;
            } else if (pivotIndex > k) {
                endIndex = pivotIndex - 1;
            } else { // pivotIndex == k
                break;
            }
        }

        return nums[k];
    }

    private int getRandomPartition(int[] nums, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
        int randomIndex = new Random().nextInt(endIndex - startIndex + 1) + startIndex;
        final int pivot = nums[randomIndex];
        swap(nums, randomIndex, endIndex);
        int smallEnd = startIndex, smallBegin = startIndex - 1;

        while (smallEnd < endIndex) {
            if (nums[smallEnd] > pivot) {
                swap(nums, ++smallBegin, smallEnd++);
            } else {
                ++ smallEnd;
            }
        }

        swap(nums, ++smallBegin, endIndex);

        return smallBegin;
    }

    private void swap(final int[] nums, int index1, int index2) {
        int temp = nums[index1];
        nums[index1] = nums[index2];
        nums[index2] = temp;
    }

}
```


# Knowledge

### Dutch national flag problem

The Dutch national flag problem (DNF) is a computer science programming problem proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue. Given balls of these three colors arranged randomly in a line (the actual number of balls does not matter), the task is to arrange them such that all balls of the same color are together and their collective color groups are in the correct order.

The solution to this problem is of interest for designing sorting algorithms; in particular, variants of the quicksort algorithm that must be robust to repeated elements need a three-way partitioning function that groups items less than a given key (red), equal to the key (white) and greater than the key (blue). Several solutions exist that have varying performance characteristics, tailored to sorting arrays with either small or large numbers of repeated elements.

#### The array case

This problem can also be viewed in terms of rearranging elements of an array. Suppose each of the possible elements could be classified into exactly one of three categories (bottom, middle, and top). For example, if all elements are in 0 ... 1, the bottom could be defined as elements in 0 ... 0.1 (not including 0.1), the middle as 0.1 ... 0.3 (not including 0.3) and the top as 0.3 and greater. (The choice of these values illustrates that the categories need not be equal ranges). The problem is then to produce an array such that all "bottom" elements come before (have an index less than the index of) all "middle" elements, which come before all "top" elements.

One algorithm is to have the top group grow down from the top of the array, the bottom group grow up from the bottom, and keep the middle group just above the bottom. The algorithm indexes three locations, the bottom of the top group, the top of the bottom group, and the top of the middle group. Elements that are yet to be sorted fall between the middle and the top group. At each step, examine the element just above the middle. If it belongs to the top group, swap it with the element just below the top. If it belongs in the bottom, swap it with the element just above the bottom. If it is in the middle, leave it. Update the appropriate index. Complexity is Θ(n) moves and examinations.


#### Pseudocode

The following pseudocode for three-way partitioning assumes zero-based array indexing. It uses three indices i, j and n, maintaining the invariant that i ≤ j. n holds the boundary of numbers greater than mid. j is the position of number under consideration. And i is the boundary for the numbers lesser than the mid.

```
procedure three-way-partition(A : array of values, mid : value):
    i ← 0
    j ← 0
    n ← size of A - 1

    while j ≤ n:
        if A[j] < mid:
            swap A[i] and A[j]
            i ← i + 1
            j ← j + 1
        else if A[j] > mid:
            swap A[j] and A[n]
            n ← n - 1
        else:
            j ← j + 1
```
