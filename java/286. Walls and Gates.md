You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.  

* -1 - A wall or an obstacle.  
* 0 - A gate.  
* INF - Infinity means an empty room. 

We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.  
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.
For example, given the 2D grid:  

```
INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
```

After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

```
  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
```

# Solution

We are asked to fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If we begin with each room to find the distance to gate, it will be quite hard to solve. It's easier to  begin with each gate and traverse to each room.

It's quite obvious that we need to use BFS or DFS to solve this problem.

Whenever we are using BFS or DFS, we should ask ourselves one question : how should we avoid visit the same spot twice? If we are not careful about handling this problem, we may end up with (1) infinite loop when we are visiting the same spot again and again (2) redundant calculations.

As for this problem, if we find the distance value of a box is smaller than we can achieve in current traversal path, we should stop going forward because we already know thoses further calculations are useless.

Besides, the value of gate(0) and obstacle(-1) gives us very good stop signs. 

### BFS
Push all gates into queue first. Then for each gate update its neighbor cells and push them to the queue.  
Repeating above steps until there is nothing left in the queue.

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int GATE = 0;
    private static final int WALL = -1;
    private static final int INF = 2147483647;
    private static final int[][] MOVE =  { { -1, 0 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, 1 }, { 0, -1 } };

    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        int rowSize = rooms.length, colSize = rooms[0].length;

        Queue<int[]> bfsQueue = new ArrayDeque<int[]>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rowSize; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < colSize; ++j) {
                if (rooms[i][j] == GATE) {
                    bfsQueue.add(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }

        while (!bfsQueue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] node = bfsQueue.poll();
            int row = node[0], col = node[1];
            for (int[] move : MOVE) {
                int nextRow = row + move[0], nextCol = col + move[1];
                if (nextRow < 0 || nextRow >= rowSize || nextCol < 0 || nextCol >= colSize) continue;
                if (rooms[nextRow][nextCol] == GATE) continue;
                if (rooms[nextRow][nextCol] > rooms[row][col] + 1) { // This check is important to prevent infinite loop.
                    rooms[nextRow][nextCol] = rooms[row][col] + 1;
                    bfsQueue.add(new int[]{nextRow, nextCol});
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### DFS

Note that in this solution, the `MOVE` operations can move the us frm `Room A` to it's adjacent room `Room B`, and then move us from `Room B` back to `Room A` we are at `Room B`. We need some way to mark `Room A` as "visited". In some similar problems, we need an auxiliary data structure(a matrix or hashset) to mark rooms as "visited". Here we do that in a smart way by checking the distance value of the adjacent room. We only move to adjacent room when it's distance can be updated with smaller value. Otherwise, why bother? 

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int GATE = 0;
    private static final int WALL = -1;
    private static final int INF = 2147483647;
    private static final int[][] MOVE =  { { -1, 0 }, { 1, 0 }, { 0, 1 }, { 0, -1 } };

    public void wallsAndGates(int[][] rooms) {
        for (int i = 0; i < rooms.length; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rooms[0].length; ++j) {
                if (rooms[i][j] == GATE) {
                    findDistance(rooms, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void findDistance(int[][] rooms,
                              int row,
                              int col) {
        int rowSize = rooms.length, colSize = rooms[0].length;

        for (int[] move : MOVE) {
            int nextRow = row + move[0], nextCol = col + move[1];
            if (nextRow < 0 || nextRow >= rowSize || nextCol < 0 || nextCol >= colSize) continue;
            if (rooms[nextRow][nextCol] == GATE) continue;
            if (rooms[nextRow][nextCol] > rooms[row][col] + 1) { // This check is important to prevent infinite loop.
                rooms[nextRow][nextCol] = rooms[row][col] + 1;
                findDistance(rooms, nextRow, nextCol);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
