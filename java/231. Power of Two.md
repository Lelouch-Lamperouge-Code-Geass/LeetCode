Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: 218
Output: false
```

# Solution

Note that integer can be negative or zero.

In sign-magnitude representation: The most-significant bit (msb) is the sign bit, with value of 0 representing positive integer and 1 representing negative integer. The remaining n-1 bits represents the magnitude (absolute value) of the integer.

In this question, we just need to make sure the number is positive and only has one set bit.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}
```
