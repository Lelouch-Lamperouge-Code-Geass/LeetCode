In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Note:

The given numbers of 0s and 1s will both not exceed 100
The size of given string array won't exceed 600.
 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, 
which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: Array = {"10", "0", "1"}, m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2

Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. 
Better form "0" and "1".
```

# Solution

This problem is a typical 0-1 [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), while unlike the formmer which is two-dimension, this problem is three-dimension.

We need to pick several strings in provided strings to get the maximum number of strings using limited number 0 and 1. We can create a three dimensional array, in which dp[t][i][j] means the maximum number of strings we can get from the first `t` argument strs using limited `i` number of '0's and `j` number of '1's.

__Time complexity: `O(SizeOfStrs * m * n)`, space complexity: `O(SizeOfStrs * m * n)`.__

Same as other dynamic programmin problem, you can reduce one dimention off the matrix.You can improve the space complexity here to `O(m * n)`. While during interview it's best to come up with the straightforward solution first, and then if intervewer requires, improve the space complexity. During actual software development, also note that better readability is more important than optimization in most scanarios.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][][] maxForm = new int[strs.length + 1][m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int strsLen = 1; strsLen < strs.length + 1; ++ strsLen) {
            int zeroCount = 0, oneCount = 0;
            for (char ch : strs[strsLen - 1].toCharArray()) {
                if (ch == '0') {
                    ++ zeroCount;
                } else if (ch == '1') {
                    ++ oneCount;
                }
            }
            

            for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
                    if (i >= zeroCount && j >= oneCount) {
                        maxForm[strsLen][i][j] = Math.max(maxForm[strsLen - 1][i][j], 
                                maxForm[strsLen - 1][i - zeroCount][j - oneCount] + 1);
                    } else {
                        maxForm[strsLen][i][j] = maxForm[strsLen - 1][i][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxForm[strs.length][m][n];
    }
}
```
