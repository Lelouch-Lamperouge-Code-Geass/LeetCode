Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

# Solution

### Solve it with char counter

Note that since the strings are consist of only lowercase letters, we just need a 26 size char counter.

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] charCounter = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            ++ charCounter[c - 'a'];
        }

        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            -- charCounter[c - 'a'];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (charCounter[i] != 0) return (char)('a' + i);
        }
        
        return ' ';
    }
}
```

### Solve it with bit manipulation


```java
class Solution {
  public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    char c = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
      c ^= s.charAt(i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); ++i) {
      c ^= t.charAt(i);
    }
    return c;
  }
}
```
