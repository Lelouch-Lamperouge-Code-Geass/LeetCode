Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i ? j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:
```
Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Return 3.
The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
```

# Solution

### Solution one

First of all, let's look at the naive solution. Preprocess to calculate the prefix sums S[i] = S(0, i), then S(i, j) = S[j] - S[i]. Note that here we define S(i, j) as the sum of range [i, j) where j exclusive and j > i. With these prefix sums, it is trivial to see that with O(n^2) time we can find all S(i, j) in the range [lower, upper].

```java
public int countRangeSum(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
    int n = nums.length;
    long[] sums = new long[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        sums[i + 1] = sums[i] + nums[i];
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j)
            if (sums[j] - sums[i] >= lower && sums[j] - sums[i] <= upper)
                ans++;
    return ans;
}
```

Recall count smaller number after self where we encountered the problem

```
count[i] = count of nums[j] - nums[i] < 0 with j > i
```

Here, after we did the preprocess, we need to solve the problem

```
count[i] = count of a <= S[j] - S[i] <= b with j > i
ans = sum(count[:])
```

Therefore the two problems are almost the same. We can use the same technique used in that problem to solve this problem. One solution is merge sort based; another one is Balanced BST based. __The time complexity are both O(n log n).__

The merge sort based solution counts the answer while doing the merge. During the merge stage, we have already sorted the left half [start, mid) and right half [mid, end). We then iterate through the left half with index i. For each i, we need to find two indices k and j in the right half where

```
j is the first index satisfy sums[j] - sums[i] > upper and
k is the first index satisfy sums[k] - sums[i] >= lower.
```

Then the number of sums in [lower, upper] is j-k. We also use another index t to copy the elements satisfy sums[t] < sums[i] to a cache in order to complete the merge sort.

Despite the nested loops, the time complexity of the "merge & count" stage is still linear. Because the indices k, j, t will only increase but not decrease, each of them will only traversal the right half once at most. The total time complexity of this divide and conquer solution is then O(n log n).

One other concern is that the sums may overflow integer. So we use long instead.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countRangeSum(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        long[] rangeSum = new long[nums.length + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            rangeSum[i+1] = rangeSum[i] + nums[i];
        }

        return countRangeSumWithMergeSort(rangeSum, 0, rangeSum.length - 1, lower, upper);
    }

    private int countRangeSumWithMergeSort(long[] rangeSum, int startIndex, 
                                           int endIndex, int lower, int upper) {
        if (startIndex >= endIndex) return 0;

        int midIndex = startIndex + (endIndex - startIndex) / 2;
        int leftCount = countRangeSumWithMergeSort(rangeSum, startIndex, midIndex, lower, upper);
        int rightCount = countRangeSumWithMergeSort(rangeSum, midIndex + 1, endIndex, lower, upper);
        int count = leftCount + rightCount;

        // Merge
        long[] temp = new long[endIndex + 1 - startIndex];
        int tempIndex = 0;

        int leftIndex = startIndex, rightIndex = midIndex + 1;
        int low = midIndex + 1, high = midIndex + 1;
        while (leftIndex <= midIndex ) {
            while (low <= endIndex && rangeSum[low] - rangeSum[leftIndex] < lower) {
                ++ low;
            }
            while (high <= endIndex && rangeSum[high] - rangeSum[leftIndex] <= upper) {
                ++ high;
            }
            while (rightIndex <= endIndex && rangeSum[rightIndex] < rangeSum[leftIndex]) {
                temp[tempIndex++] = rangeSum[rightIndex++];
            }
            temp[tempIndex++] = rangeSum[leftIndex++];
            count += high - low;
        }


        while (rightIndex <= endIndex) {
            temp[tempIndex++] = rangeSum[rightIndex++];
        }

        System.arraycopy(temp, 0, rangeSum, startIndex, temp.length);
        return count;
    }
}
```
