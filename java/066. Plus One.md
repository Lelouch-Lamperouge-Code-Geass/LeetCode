Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.


# Solution

One edge case is how to handle number like "9999...".

Best practice is that we should not modify input value, and should return a brain new array instead.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        std::size_t pos(digits.size()); // we know its non-empty array
        
        // Find the first non-9 digit backward
        while (pos > 0) { // LeetCode has a weired compiler which makes pos -- > 0 WRONG! WTF!
            -- pos;
            if (digits[pos] != 9) {
                ++ digits[pos];
                return digits;
            } else {
                digits[pos] = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // it was 99....
        digits[pos] = 1;
        digits.push_back(0);
        
        return digits;
    }
};
```

### Are arrays passed by value or passed by reference in Java?

Like all Java objects, arrays are passed by value ... but the value is the reference to the array. So, when you assign something to a cell of the array in the called method, you will be assigning to the same array object that the caller sees.

This is NOT pass-by-reference. Real pass-by-reference involves passing the address of a variable. With real pass-by-reference, the called method can assign to its local variable, and this causes the variable in the caller to be updated.

But not in Java. In Java, the called method can update the contents of the array, and it can update its copy of the array reference, but it can't update the variable in the caller that holds the caller's array reference. Hence ... what Java is providing is NOT pass-by-reference.
