Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

__Example:__

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
```

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.

# Solution

Think about the recurrence relation first. How does the number of combinations of the target related to the number of combinations of numbers that are smaller than the target?

So we know that target is the sum of numbers in the array. Imagine we only need one more number to reach target, this number can be any one in the array, right? So the number of combinations of target, `comb[target] = sum(comb[target - nums[i]])`, where `0 <= i < nums.length, and target >= nums[i]`.

In the example given, we can actually find the number of combinations of 4 with the number of combinations of `3(4 - 1)`, `2(4- 2)` and `1(4 - 3)`. As a result, `comb[4] = comb[4-1] + comb[4-2] + comb[4-3] = comb[3] + comb[2] + comb[1]`.

Then think about the base case. Since if the target is 0, there is only one way to get zero, which is using 0, we can set `comb[0] = 1`.

EDIT: The problem says that target is a positive integer that makes me feel it's unclear to put it in the above way. Since target == 0 only happens when in the previous call, target = nums[i], we know that this is the only combination in this case, so we return 1.

Now we can come up with at least a recursive solution.

```java
public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
    if (target == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (target >= nums[i]) {
            res += combinationSum4(nums, target - nums[i]);
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

Now for a DP solution, we just need to figure out a way to store the intermediate results, to avoid the same combination sum being calculated many times. We can use an array to save those results, and check if there is already a result before calculation. We can fill the array with -1 to indicate that the result hasn't been calculated yet. 0 is not a good choice because it means there is no combination sum for the target.

```java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] numberOfCombinations = new int[target + 1];
        Arrays.fill(numberOfCombinations, -1);
        numberOfCombinations[0] = 1;
        return findNumberOfCombinations(nums, target, numberOfCombinations);
    }

    private int findNumberOfCombinations(int[] nums, int target, int[] numberOfCombinations) {
        if (numberOfCombinations[target] != -1) {
            return numberOfCombinations[target];
        } else {
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (target < num) continue;
                count += findNumberOfCombinations(nums, target - num, numberOfCombinations);
            }
            numberOfCombinations[target] = count;
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

EDIT: The above solution is top-down. How about a bottom-up one?

```java
class Solution {
     public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] numberOfCombinations = new int[target + 1];
        numberOfCombinations[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (i - num < 0) continue;
                numberOfCombinations[i] += numberOfCombinations[i - num];
            }
        }

        return numberOfCombinations[target];
    }
}
```

__Follow-up__

The problem with negative numbers is that now the combinations could be potentially of infinite length. Think about `nums = [-1, 1]` and `target = 1`. We can have all sequences of arbitrary length that follow the patterns `-1, 1, -1, 1, ..., -1, 1, 1` and `1, -1, 1, -1, ..., 1, -1, 1` (there are also others, of course, just to give an example). So we should limit the length of the combination sequence, or to add a requirement that each number is only used one time, the main purpose is to give a bound to the problem.

Therefore if there are negative numbers in the array, we must add a requirement that each number is only used one time, or either positive number or negative number should be used only one time, otherwise there would be infinite possible combinations.
