Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

__Example 1:__

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

# Solution

The logic is very similar to NO.347 and here we just use a map a count and according to the frequency to put it into the right bucket. Then we go through the bucket to get the most frequently character and append that to the final stringbuilder.

```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> charCounter = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCounter.put(c, charCounter.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Character> [] frequencyBucket = new List[s.length() + 1];
        for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer>  entry : charCounter.entrySet()) {
            if (frequencyBucket[entry.getValue()] == null) {
                frequencyBucket[entry.getValue()] = new ArrayList<>();
            }
            frequencyBucket[entry.getValue()].add(entry.getKey());
        }

        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (int frequency = frequencyBucket.length - 1; frequency >= 0; --frequency) {
            if (frequencyBucket[frequency] != null) {
                for (Character c : frequencyBucket[frequency]) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < frequency; ++i) {
                        stringBuilder.append(c);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }
}
```

And we have normal way using PriorityQueue as follows:

according to user "orxanb", O(nlogm), m is the distinguish character, can be O(1) since only 26 letters. So the overall time complexity should be O(n), the same as the buck sort with less memory use.

```java
public class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray())
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
						
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Character, Integer>> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b.getValue() - a.getValue());
        pq.addAll(map.entrySet());
				
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Map.Entry e = pq.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < (int)e.getValue(); i++) 
                sb.append(e.getKey());
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
