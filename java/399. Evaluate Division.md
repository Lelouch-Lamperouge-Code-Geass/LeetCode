Equations are given in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.

Example:

```
Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
```

The input is: `vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>>` queries , where `equations.size() == values.size()`, and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return `vector<double>`.

According to the example above:

```
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
values = [2.0, 3.0],
queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
```

__The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.__

# Solution


Binary relationship is represented as a graph usually.

Does the direction of an edge matters? -- Yes. Take a / b = 2 for example, it indicates a --2--> b as well as b --1/2--> a.
Thus, it is a directed weighted graph.

In this graph, how do we evaluate division?

Take a / b = 2, b / c = 3, a / c = ? for example,

```
a --2--> b --3--> c
a <--0.5-- b <--1/3--> c
```

We simply find a path using DFS from node a to node c and multiply the weights of edges passed, i.e. 2 * 3 = 6.
