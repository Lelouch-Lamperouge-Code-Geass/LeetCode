We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

__Example :__

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

# Solution

This leetcode problem's description is crap, and actually this whole problem is crap as well.

Let's give an example.

Here are two people, `A`(this process) and `B`(another process). `A` pick a number `n = 10`, and somehow `B`(another process) knows the value `n = 10` and picked a number. `A`(this process) need to find out what that number it is by calling an API `int guess(int num);` of `B`. This API return -1 if the picked number is lower thatn our guess, 1 if higher.


```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int revalOfGuess = guess(mid);
            if (revalOfGuess == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else if (revalOfGuess == 1) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
