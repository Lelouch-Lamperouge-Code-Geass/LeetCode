Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.
 
```
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") ? false
isMatch("aa","aa") ? true
isMatch("aaa","aa") ? false
isMatch("aa", "*") ? true
isMatch("aa", "a*") ? true
isMatch("ab", "?*") ? true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") ? false
```

# Solution

First of all, you need have a clear understand about the difference between regular expression and wildcard.

You can compare this problem to the Leetcode problem 10.

The main difference between these two problems is the usage of '\*'.

In wildcard, '\*' can match any sequence of characters, including empty sequence. That's why we call it "wild", because the wildcard '\*' can match way many more characters since it is not depended upon previous character.

However, in regular expression, '\*' has a direct relationship with previous character, it can negate previous character(match 0 previous character), or it can match one or multiple of the previous character.


### Solution

For each element in s  
If *s==*p or *p == ? which means this is a match, then goes to next element s++ p++.  
If p == '*', this is also a match, but one or many chars may be available, so let us save this *'s position and the matched s position.  

If not match, then we check if there is a * previously showed up,  
       if there is no *,  return false;  
       if there is an *,  we set current p to the next element of *, and set current s to the next saved s position.  

__Time complexity : O(s.size() * p.size()), Splace Complexity O(1)__

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int s_mark = -1, p_mark = -1;
        while (i < s.length()) { // can't check j < p.length() here, think about "abc","*"
            if (j < p.length() && p.charAt(j) == '*') {
                // mark both positions when meet *
                s_mark = i;
                p_mark = j;
                ++ j; // only move j forward
            } else {
                if (j < p.length()
                        && (p.charAt(j) == '?' || s.charAt(i) == p.charAt(j))
                    ) {
                    ++ i;
                    ++ j;
                } else {
                    if (p_mark != -1) {
                        i = ++ s_mark; // use wildcard to match one more char in s
                        j = p_mark + 1;
                    } else {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        while (j < p.length() && p.charAt(j) == '*') ++ j;
        return j == p.length();
    }
}
```
