Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

__Example:__

```
Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
```

# Solution

For every point, we calculate the distance between it and any other point, and use a HashMap to store <Distance, CountOfDistance>. We don't need to take squre root to calculate the actual distance, just use the squared sum should be fine.

__Time complexity: `O(n ^ 2)`__

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {
        int reval = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; ++i) {
            HashMap<Long, Integer> distanceCounter = new HashMap<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < points.length; ++j) {
                if (j == i) continue; // not same point

                long distance = getDistance(points[i], points[j]);
                distanceCounter.put(distance, distanceCounter.getOrDefault(distance, 0) + 1);
            }

            for (Map.Entry<Long, Integer> entry : distanceCounter.entrySet()) {
                int count = entry.getValue();
                reval += count * (count - 1);
            }

        }

        return reval;
    }

    private long getDistance(int[] a, int[] b) {
        long dx = a[0] - b[0];
        long dy = a[1] - b[1];

        return dx * dx + dy * dy;
    }
}
```
