Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. 

# Solution

Here is my idea: instead of calculating area by ```height * width```, we can think it in a cumulative way. In other words, sum water amount of each bin(```width = 1```).  

For each bin, the water it can contain = ```min(max_left, max_right) - cur_val```.  

That is to say, the water each bin can contain is limited by minimal value between the max height of its left bars and the max height of its right bars.  
             
Then how to implement this algorithm?

The simple way is to keep two arrays, one is called ```max_left[]```, one is called ```max_right[]```. We iterate the input from left to right to record the ```max_left``` on each bin, and iterate from right to left to record the ```max_right``` on each bin. Then accumulate at the final iteration with ```max(0, min(max_left[i],max_right[i]) - height[i])```.

In this case, the time complexity is O(n), and space complexity is O(n).


```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int[] maxLeft = new int[height.length];
        int[] maxRight = new int[height.length];
        
        int maxtHeight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < height.length; ++i) {
            maxtHeight = Integer.max(maxtHeight, height[i]);
            maxLeft[i] = maxtHeight;
        }

        maxtHeight = 0;
        for (int i = height.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            maxtHeight = Integer.max(maxtHeight, height[i]);
            maxRight[i] = maxtHeight;
        }
        
        int reval = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < height.length; ++i) {
            reval += Integer.max(0, Integer.min(maxLeft[i], maxRight[i]) - height[i]);
        }
        
        return reval;
    }
}
```

Can we improve this algorithm? Probably not on time complexity, since we have to visit each bin no matter what.

How about space complexity?  It turns out, we just need use a trick similar to two pointers, left and right. So we can accumulate from both sides to its middle.  

* If maxLeft <= maxRight, collecting water on left bin
* Else, collecting water on right bin.

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) return 0;

        int maxLeft = 0, maxRight = 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int reval = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            maxLeft = Integer.max(maxLeft, height[left]);
            maxRight = Integer.max(maxRight, height[right]);

            if (maxLeft <= maxRight) { // Collecting water on left bin
                reval += maxLeft - height[left];
                ++ left;
            } else  { // Collecting water on right bin
                reval += maxRight - height[right];
                -- right;
            }
        }

        return reval;
    }
}
```
