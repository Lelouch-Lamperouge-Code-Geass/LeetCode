Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

* The number at the i-th position is divisible by i.
* i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?


__Example 1__:

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```

__Note__:

* N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

```java
class Solution {
    private int count = 0;
    public int countArrangement(int N) {
        count = 0; // reset
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[N + 1];
        calculate(N, 1, visited);
        return count;
    }
    
    private void calculate(int N, int pos, boolean[] visited) {
        if (pos > N) { 
            ++ count;
        } else {
            for (int num = 1; num <= N; ++num) {
                if (!visited[num] 
                    && ((pos % num) == 0 || (num % pos) == 0)
                   ) {
                    visited[num] = true;
                    calculate(N, pos + 1, visited);
                    visited[num] = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
