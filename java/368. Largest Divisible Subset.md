Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

`Si % Sj = 0` or `Sj % Si = 0`.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]
```

# Solution

Given a set of integers that satisfies the property that each pair of integers inside the set are mutually divisible, for a new integer `S`, `S` can be placed into the set as long as it can divide the smallest number of the set or is divisible by the largest number of the set.

For example, let's say we have a set `P = { 4, 8, 16 }`, `P` satisfies the divisible condition. Now consider a new number 2, it can divide the smallest number 4, so it can be placed into the set; similarly, 32 can be divided by 16, the biggest number in `P`, it can also placed into `P`.

After sorted `nums`, we can find out that if we know that largest subset for each index, then the final result is the lastest one among these candidates. This problem has [optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure).

Here is how it works:

* Sort `nums` first
* For every index, we keep tracking these information about the max divisible subset including itself: 1) the prefix of this subset 2) the length of this subset. 
* We also have one variable `maxSubsetLastIndex` to track the last index and and one variable `maxSubsetLen` to track the length of the max divisible subset so far, and update their value on every index.
* Eventually we use `maxSubsetLastIndex` to keep finding it's prefix number and add them together as the final result.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> largestDivisibleSubset(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
         // Record the max subset length on each index
        int[] subsetLen = new int[nums.length];
        // Record the previous index of that max subset on each index
        int[] subsetPreIndex = new int[nums.length];

        int maxSubsetLen = 0, maxSubsetLastIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            subsetLen[i] = 1;
            subsetPreIndex[i] = -1;
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if ( (nums[i] % nums[j]) == 0
                        && subsetLen[j] + 1 > subsetLen[i]) {
                    subsetLen[i] = subsetLen[j] + 1;
                    subsetPreIndex[i] = j;
                }
            }
            
            if (subsetLen[i] > maxSubsetLen) {
                maxSubsetLen = subsetLen[i];
                maxSubsetLastIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> reval = new ArrayList<>();
        while (maxSubsetLastIndex != -1) {
            reval.add(0, nums[maxSubsetLastIndex]); 
            // reval.add(nums[maxSubsetLastIndex]) is also fine since no order requirement
            maxSubsetLastIndex = subsetPreIndex[maxSubsetLastIndex];
        }

        return reval;
    }
}
```
