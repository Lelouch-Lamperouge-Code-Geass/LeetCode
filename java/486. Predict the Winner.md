Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. 
If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. 
No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

__Note:__

* 1 <= length of the array <= 20.   
* Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.  
* If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.   

# Solution

### Solve with recusion

The simple recursion method can be something like this:

```
private void calculate(nt[] nums, int start, int end, Integer sumForPlayer1, Integer sumForPlayer2, boolean turnForPlayer1)
```

we use `sumForPlayer1` to store the sum for player1, and `sumForPlayer2` to store the sum for player2.

Here, we use some trick to simplify the method.

```
private int maxSum(int[] nums, int start, int end)
```

return the sum difference for current player(can be either player1 or player2) against the other player. 

If `nums` has 4 items, then:

```
maxSum(nums, 0, 3) // return scoreOfplayer1 - scoreOfplayer2
maxSum(nums, 1, 3),  maxSum(nums, 0, 2)// return scoreOfplayer2 - scoreOfplayer1
maxSum(nums, 2, 3), maxSum(nums, 1, 2),  maxSum(nums, 1, 2), maxSum(nums, 0, 1)// return scoreOfplayer1 - scoreOfplayer2
...

```

Wen can use a cache to avoid duplicate calculation on the same range.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        return maxSum(nums, 0, nums.length - 1) >= 0;
    }
    
    // Return the sum difference for current player(can be either player1 or player2)
    // against the other player.
    private int maxSum(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start == end) {
            return nums[start];
        } else {
            return Math.max(
                    nums[start] - maxSum(nums, start + 1, end), // pick first number
                    nums[end] - maxSum(nums, start, end - 1) // pick last number
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Time complexity : `O(2^n)`. Size of recursion tree will be `2^n`. Here, `n` refers to the length of numsnums array.
Space complexity : `O(n)`. The depth of the recursion tree can go upto `n`.
