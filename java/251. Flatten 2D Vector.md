Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.

For example,
```
Given 2d vector =

[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
``` 

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Hint:

* How many variables do you need to keep track?  
* Two variables is all you need. Try with x and y.  
* Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.  
* To write correct code, think about the invariant to maintain. What is it?  
* The invariant is x and y must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant ahead of time or right when you need it?  
* Not sure? Think about how you would implement hasNext(). Which is more complex?  
* Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.  

Follow up:  
* As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.

# Solution

Note that both hasNext() and next() can be called many many times. In this case, we need to make sure that hasNext() don't move pointer forward, and next() should always move pointer forward.

Also check above hints for corner cases.

### With one iterator

```java
public class Vector2D {
    List<Iterator<Integer>> iteratorList = new ArrayList<Iterator<Integer>>();
    int curr = 0;

    public Vector2D(List<List<Integer>> vec2d) {
        for (List<Integer> vec : vec2d) {
            if (!vec.isEmpty()) {
                iteratorList.add(vec.iterator());
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return curr < iteratorList.size() && iteratorList.get(curr).hasNext();
    }

    public int next() {
        if (!iteratorList.get(curr).hasNext()) {
            ++ curr;
        }
        return iteratorList.get(curr).next();
    }
}
```

### With two iterators

Note that in previous solution, we only store the iterators for lists that are not empty, which makes it easier to handle.
Since we are using iterators only here, we need to take care of empty list scenario.

```java
public class Vector2D {

        Iterator<List<Integer>> rowIterator;
        Iterator<Integer> colIterator;

        public Vector2D(List<List<Integer>> vec2d) {
            rowIterator = vec2d.iterator();
            colIterator = rowIterator.next().iterator();
        }

        public boolean hasNext() {
            while (!colIterator.hasNext()
                    && rowIterator.hasNext()) {
                colIterator = rowIterator.next().iterator();
            }

            return colIterator.hasNext();
        }

        public int next() {
            hasNext();
            return colIterator.next();
        }
    }
```
