Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

* push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
* pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
* top() -- Get the top element.
* getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

Example:

```
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.
```

# Solution

The most intuitive solution is storing number as well as minimal value as a pair on each entry, but this means that it will use twice the memory of all the numbers.

How can we do better?

We can use a variable `minValue` to track the minimal value, however, the tricky part is that whenever we pop a number out of the stack, we need somehow recover the old minimal value. Therefore, the stack element should store a value that should:

* Can be used with `minValue` to return current top value, `top()`
* Can be used to recover the old minimal value when current number is popped out.

The idea is to store the gap between the min value and the current value.

Using one extra space to store m_min. m_min always stores the minimal value.

What the stack stores is the gap between current number and the minimum value if we pop current number out, it equals 

```current_number - minimum_value_we_get_if_pop_current_number```, or you can say

```current_number - pre_minimal_value_before_add_current_number```.

Therefore, when we call top(). There are two scenarios:

1. top() <= 0 : which means current value is even smaller or at least equal to minimum value we can get if we pop current number out. So just return m_min.
2. top() is positive : which means current value is bigger than previous value, so return top() + m_min. This means that we did not modify m_min when we add this number.

When we call pop(), we just need to make sure update m_min when top() is negative.

Using long here to handle overflow.
  
```java
class MinStack {

    public MinStack() {

    }

    public void push(int x) {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            minValue = x;
            stack.push(0L);
        } else {
            stack.push(x - minValue);

            if (x < minValue) {
                minValue = x;
            }
        }
    }

    public void pop() {
        if (stack.peek() < 0) {
            minValue -= stack.peek();
        }
        stack.pop();
    }

    public int top() {
        return (int) (stack.peek() <= 0L ? minValue : minValue + stack.peek());
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return (int) minValue;
    }

    private Stack<Long> stack = new Stack<>();
    private long minValue = 0;

}

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack obj = new MinStack();
 * obj.push(x);
 * obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.getMin();
 */
