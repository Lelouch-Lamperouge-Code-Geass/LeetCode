Given an m x n matrix of positive integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

__Example:__

```
Given the following 3x6 height map:
[
  [1,4,3,1,3,2],
  [3,2,1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,2,3,1]
]

Return 4.
```

The above image represents the elevation map `[[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]` before the rain.

After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water trapped is 4.

__Constraints:__

* 1 <= m, n <= 110  
* 0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 20000

From the borders, pick the shortest cell visited and check its neighbors:

* if the neighbor is shorter, collect the water it can trap and update its height as its height plus the water trapped  
* add all its neighbors to the queue  

Reason is, we start from shortest cell(imaging there are many tall walls surrounding those cells which are short, and we start from the shortest wall) to find the neighbor which is shorter than the shortest wall (this poor short neighbor is going to trap water because it's shorter than the shortest wall so that it's also shorter than all other wall surrounding it.)

Imagine the pool is surrounded by many bars. The water can only go out from the lowest bar. So we always start from the lowest boundary and keep pushing the bar from boundary towards inside. It works as if we are replacing the old bars with a bar higher than it.

See the following simple example:

```
4 4 4 4
4 0 1 2
4 4 4 4
```

It looks like we push the bar of 2 towards left and record the difference. Then you can use the same procedure with the following figure

```
4 4 4 4
4 0 2 2
4 4 4 4
```
