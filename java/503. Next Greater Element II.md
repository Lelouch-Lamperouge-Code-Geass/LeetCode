Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

__Note:__ The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

# Solution

The approach is same as Next Greater Element I.

__Time complexity O(n), space complexity O(n).__

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int[] reval = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(reval, -1);
        Stack<Integer> indexStack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length * 2; ++i) {

            // For all previous smaller number, nums[i % nums.length] is
            // their "next greater number".
            while (!indexStack.isEmpty()
                && nums[i % nums.length] > nums[indexStack.peek()]) {
                reval[indexStack.peek()] = nums[i % nums.length];
                indexStack.pop();
            }
            
            if (i < nums.length) {
                indexStack.push(i);
            }
        }

        return reval;
    }
    
}
```
