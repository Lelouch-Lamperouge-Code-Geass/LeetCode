Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

__Note:__ The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

# Solution

https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/solution/

The approach is same as Next Greater Element I.

We go through two such passes over the complete numsnums array. This is done so as to complete a circular traversal over the numsnums array. The first pass could make some wrong entries in the resres array since it considers only the elements lying to the right of `nums[i]`, without a circular traversal. But, these entries are corrected in the second pass.

Example: `9, 8, 7, 6, 5`, after the first pass, we will have the stack with `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`(stack stores index). The second pass will be:

```
i = 5, on number 9, stack becomes empty, fill reval[0~4]
i = 6, on number 8, empty stack
i = 7, on number 7, empty stack
i = 8, on number 6, empty stack
i = 9, on number 6, empty stack
```

__Time complexity O(n), space complexity O(n).__

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int[] reval = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(reval, -1);
        Stack<Integer> indexStack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length * 2; ++i) {

            // For all previous smaller number, nums[i % nums.length] is
            // their "next greater number".
            while (!indexStack.isEmpty()
                && nums[i % nums.length] > nums[indexStack.peek()]) {
                reval[indexStack.peek()] = nums[i % nums.length];
                indexStack.pop();
            }
            
            if (i < nums.length) {
                indexStack.push(i);
            }
        }

        return reval;
    }
    
}
```
