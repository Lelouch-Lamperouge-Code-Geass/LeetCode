A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

* For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.  
* For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.  

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

```
   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.

__Note:__

The input is an array of integers. Only the __least significant 8 bits__ of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

__Example 1:__

```
data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

Return true.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
```

__Example 2:__

```
data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

Return false.

The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
        int numberOfBytes = 0;

        for (int item : data) {
            if (item > 255) return false; // each integer can only represents 1 byte of data
            if (numberOfBytes == 0) {
                if ((item >> 3) == 0b11110) {
                    numberOfBytes = 3;
                } else if ((item >> 4) == 0b1110) {
                    numberOfBytes = 2;
                } else if ((item >> 5) == 0b110) {
                    numberOfBytes = 1;
                } else if ((item >> 7) == 0b1) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                if((item >> 6) != 0b10) return false;
                else -- numberOfBytes;
            }
        }
        
        return numberOfBytes == 0;
    }
}
```

### Java Binary Literals

Java added a new feature Binary Literal in Java 7. I allows you to express integral types (byte, short, int, and long) in binary number system. To specify a binary literal, add the prefix 0b or 0B to the integral value.

```java
int anInt2 = 0b101;
int anInt3 = 0B101; // The B can be upper or lower case.
```
