An abbreviation of a word follows the form <first letter><number><last letter>. 
Below are some examples of word abbreviations:
```
a) it                      --> it    (no abbreviation)

     1
b) d|o|g                   --> d1g

              1    1  1
     1---5----0----5--8
c) i|nternationalizatio|n  --> i18n

              1
     1---5----0
d) l|ocalizatio|n          --> l10n
```

Assume you have a dictionary and given a word, find whether its abbreviation is unique in the dictionary. 
A word's abbreviation is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation.
Example: 

```
Given dictionary = [ "deer", "door", "cake", "card" ]

isUnique("dear") -> false
isUnique("cart") -> true
isUnique("cane") -> false
isUnique("make") -> true
```


# Solution

The description (A word's abbreviation is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation) 
is clear however a bit twisting. It took me a few "Wrong Answer"s to finally understand what it's asking for.
We are trying to search for a word in a dictionary. If this word (also this word’s abbreviation) 
is not in the dictionary OR this word and only it’s abbreviation in the dictionary. 
We call a word’s abbreviation unique.
EX:
```
1) [“dog”]; isUnique(“dig”);   
// False, because “dig” has the same abbreviation with “dog" and “dog” is already in the dictionary. 
// It’s not unique.

2) [“dog”, “dog"]; isUnique(“dog”);  
// True, because “dog” is the only word that has “d1g” abbreviation.

3) [“dog”, “dig”]; isUnique(“dog”);   
// False, because if we have more than one word match to the same abbreviation, 
// this abbreviation will never be unique.
```

To me, the most ridiculous part of the spec is that there may be duplicates in the given dictionary of words.

Come on, it is called a dictionary!!!

思路: 将字典中的单词按照缩写为key, 将具有相同缩写的放进一个hash表中. 当判断一个给定单词是否唯一的时候,可以先计算出其缩写, 然后去hash表中查, 如果hash表中这个缩写对应几个单词, 那么肯定是不唯一的, 如果只对应一个单词, 则看这个单词是不是我们要判断的单词, 如果是的话,则唯一, 否则不唯一. 如果这个缩写在hash表中没有对应单词, 那么肯定唯一了.

There are two cases that satisfies unique abbreviation:

1. For word whose abbreviation is not in the dictionary, then it definitely has an unique abbreviation.
2. For word whose abbreviation is in the dictionary, then if it is the only word in this dictionry which has such abbreviation, still should return true.

```java
public class ValidWordAbbr {

    private HashMap<String, HashSet<String>> abbreviations = new HashMap<>();

    public ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary) {
        for (String word : dictionary) {
            String abbr = getAbbr(word);
            if (!abbreviations.containsKey(abbr)) {
                abbreviations.put(abbr, new HashSet<>());
            }
            abbreviations.get(abbr).add(word);
        }
    }

    public boolean isUnique(String word) {
        String abbr = getAbbr(word);
        return !abbreviations.containsKey(abbr)
                || abbreviations.get(abbr).size() == 1 && abbreviations.get(abbr).contains(word);
    }

    private String getAbbr(String s) {
        if (s.length() < 3) return s;
        else return s.charAt(0) + String.valueOf(s.length() - 2) + s.charAt(s.length() - 1);
    }
}
```
