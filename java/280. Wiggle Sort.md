Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it _in-place_ such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....
For example, given nums = [3, 5, 2, 1, 6, 4], one possible answer is [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4].

# Solution

Note that it requires us to implement an [__in-place__ algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.

If not such in-place requirement, we can divide the array into big and small number groups, and put small numbers to even index, big numbers to odd index, or vice versa.



The final sorted nums needs to satisfy two conditions:

* If i is odd, then nums[i] >= nums[i - 1];
* If i is even, then nums[i] <= nums[i - 1].

The code is just to fix the orderings of nums that do not satisfy 1 and 2.

__It's important to understand why this algorithm works.__

```
Proof of correctness:
Let's use induction:
Base case: only one element is processed, no constraints are violated.
Step: 
1. if i % 2 == 0: If we do not swap anything at this step, the prefix remains valid. 
   Otherwise, we have the following situation: a[i - 2] >= a[i - 1] > a[i]. 
   When we make a swap, we can see that the constraints are not violated 
   for the i - 2 and i - 1 elements, 
   and the last position is fixed. 
2. For an odd i, the situation is similar.
```

Suppose nums[0 .. i - 1] is wiggled, for position i:
* if i is odd, we already have, nums[i - 2] >= nums[i - 1],
    * if nums[i - 1] <= nums[i], then we does not need to do anything, its already wiggled.
    * if nums[i - 1] > nums[i], then we swap element at i -1 and i. Due to previous wiggled elements (nums[i - 2] >= nums[i - 1]), we know after swap the sequence is ensured to be nums[i - 2] > nums[i - 1] < nums[i], which is wiggled.

Similarly,
* if i is even, we already have, nums[i - 2] <= nums[i - 1],
    * if nums[i - 1] >= nums[i], pass
    * if nums[i - 1] < nums[i], after swap, we are sure to have wiggled nums[i - 2] < nums[i - 1] > nums[i].

The same recursive solution applies to all the elements in the sequence, ensuring the algo success.

__Time complexity O(N) Space complexity O(1)__

```cpp
class Solution {
    public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if ( (i  % 2) == 0 ) { // even
                if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                    swap(nums, i - 1, i);
                }
            } else { // odd
                if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                    swap(nums, i - 1, i);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int index1, int index2) {
        int temp = nums[index1];
        nums[index1] = nums[index2];
        nums[index2] = temp;
    }
}
```

# Thought

__Note: the difference between this and the wiggle sort II is that in latter two adjacent number cannot be the same. And also this problem defines the wiggle style has to be ```nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3] ...```.__

For example, given nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2], one acceptable answer is [1,1,1,2,2,3,2,3,3] which is not acceptable to wiggle sort II. A valid answer to wiggle sort II is [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1].

The second solution here doesn't work for wiggle-sort-II because since no adjacent numbers can be the same, once we encountered same adjacent numbers, obviously swapping them won't work at all.
