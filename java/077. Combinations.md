### Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each __partial candidate__ ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

_Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution" and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution._ It is useless, for example, for locating a given value in an unordered table. When it is applicable, however, backtracking is often much faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates, since it can eliminate a large number of candidates with a single test.
                                                                                         
The backtracking algorithm enumerates a set of __partial candidates__ that, in principle, could be completed in various ways to give all the possible solutions to the given problem. The completion is done incrementally, by a sequence of candidate extension steps.
Conceptually, the partial candidates are represented as the nodes of a tree structure, the __potential search tree__. Each partial candidate is the parent of the candidates that differ from it by a single extension step; the leaves of the tree are the partial candidates that cannot be extended any further.
                                                                                         
The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively, from the root down, in _depth-first order_. At each node c, the algorithm checks whether c can be completed to a valid solution. _If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at c is __skipped (pruned)__._ Otherwise, the algorithm (1) checks whether c itself is a valid solution, and if so reports it to the user; and (2) recursively enumerates all sub-trees of c. The two tests and the children of each node are defined by user-given procedures.
                                                                                         
Therefore, the actual search tree that is traversed by the algorithm is only a part of the potential tree. __The total cost of the algorithm is the number of nodes of the actual tree times the cost of obtaining and processing each node.__ This fact should be considered when choosing the potential search tree and implementing the pruning test.
