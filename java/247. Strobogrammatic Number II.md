A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).  

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.  

For example, Given n = 2, return ["11","69","88","96"].  

# Solution

We are going to build a string of n length, what if we already know the n – 2 length solution to the problem? Then we just surround that by ‘1’ and ‘1’, ‘8’ and ‘8’, ‘6’ and ‘9’ etc.

Note that in between we can add ‘0’ and ‘0’ but at the last chance, we don’t want to surround with ‘0’ and ‘0’. Because we don’t want a “0110” in the solution. This is not part of the description of the problem. But based on the example given above, it doesn’t contain “00” in the answer, so that’s how we can guess we should not contain ‘0’ and ‘0’.

We can use the same methology as 

https://github.com/YangLiuNYU/LeetCode/blob/master/cplusplus/248_Strobogrammatic_Number_III.md

Just initialize the string with n '0', and fill it with left and right pointers.

```java
class Solution {

    private static final HashMap<Character, Character> mapper = new HashMap<Character, Character>(){
        {
            put('0', '0');
            put('1', '1');
            put('6', '9');
            put('8', '8');
            put('9', '6');
        }
    };

    public List<String> findStrobogrammatic(int n) {
        List<String> reval = new ArrayList<>();
        char[] chars = new char[n];
        buildStrobogrammaticString(reval, chars, 0, n - 1);
        return reval;
    }

    private void buildStrobogrammaticString(List<String> reval,
                                           char[] chars,
                                           int left,
                                           int right) {
        if (left > right) {
            reval.add(new String(chars));
            return;
        }

        mapper.forEach(
                (key, value) -> {
                    if (key == '0' && left == 0 && left < right) return; // Avoid "0*0"
                    if (left == right && key != value) return; // When left == right, we can only add '0', '1', '8'
                    chars[left] = key;
                    chars[right] = value;
                    buildStrobogrammaticString(reval, chars, left + 1, right - 1);
                }
        );
    }
```
