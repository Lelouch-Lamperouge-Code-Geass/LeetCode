Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

__Note:__
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("root can't be null!");
        if (k <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("k must be a positive number!");
        
        Stack<TreeNode> nodes = new Stack<>();
        while (root != null || !nodes.isEmpty()) {
            if (root != null) {
                // When root is not null and not took from stack,
                // we know it is going downward in recursion.
                while (root != null) {
                    nodes.push(root);
                    root = root.left;
                }
            } else {
                // When root is null and need took from stack,
                // we know it is going upward in recursion.
                root = nodes.pop();
                -- k;
                if (k == 0) return root.val;
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Can't find such element!");
    }
}
```
