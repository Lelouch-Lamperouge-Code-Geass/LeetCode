Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.  
The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).  
For example,  

```
   1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5
```

Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

```
   2
    \
     3
    / 
   2    
  / 
 1
```

Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3,not3-2-1, so return 2.  

### Solution

In order find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a tree, we need to know how to find the longest consecutive sequence path on every tree node. The final result will be the maximum value among them. 

```java
class Solution {

    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        Integer maxLen = 0;
        longestConsecutive(root, null, 0, maxLen);
        return maxLen;
    }

    private void longestConsecutive(final TreeNode node,
                                    final Integer preValue,
                                    final Integer preLen,
                                    Integer maxLen) {
        if (node != null) {
            int curLen = preValue != null && node.val == preValue + 1 ?
                    preLen + 1 : 1;
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, preLen);
            longestConsecutive(node.left, node.val, curLen, maxLen);
        }
    }
}
```
