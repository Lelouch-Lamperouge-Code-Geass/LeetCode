Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:

```
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].
```

Example 2:

```
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].
```

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

# Solution

Note that here the existing intervals are sorted and non-overlapping, so all we need to consider is how to add the new interval.

If the existing intervals are overlapping, the solution will be different.

You need pay attention to this kind of detail before dive into solving the problem.

Some questions to ask before beging to solve the problem:

* can intervals be null, or empty? what if interval is null or empty, but newInterval is not ull nor empty?
* can newInterval be null, or empty?
* are intervals sorted or not? are there any overlapping interval in intervals?

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {
        if (newInterval == null || newInterval.length == 0) return intervals;

        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();

        int index = 0;

        // add all the intervals ending before newInterval starts
        while (index < intervals.length && intervals[index][1] < newInterval[0]) {
            result.add(intervals[index]);
            ++ index;
        }

        // merge all overlapping intervals to one considering newInterval
        while(index < intervals.length
                && intervals[index][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
            newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0], intervals[index][0]);
            newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], intervals[index][1]);
            ++ index;
        }
        result.add(newInterval); // add the union of intervals we got

        // Add the rest intervals
        while(index < intervals.length) {
            result.add(intervals[index]);
            ++ index;
        }

        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }
}
```
