A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following: `S = "1221121221221121122……"`

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

```
1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......
```

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

```
1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......
```

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" 
and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```

# Solution

Algorithm:

* Create an int array a and initialize the first 3 elements with `[1, 2, 2]`. The first number `1` means there is 1 `1`, the second number `2` means there is 2 `2`. The third number `2` means there should be 2 `1` for the fourth and fifth numbers. Therefore we set `countIndex = 2, num = 1`. We also use `oneCounter` to count `1`.
* `countIndex` points to the number which will be used to generate new numbers. `index` points to the next empty position to put the new number. Then keep generating new numbers until `index == n`.
* A trick to flip number back and forth between 1 and 2: `num = num ^ 3`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        if (n <= 3) return 1;

        int[] magicalString = new int[n];
        magicalString[0] = 1;
        magicalString[1] = 2;
        magicalString[2] = 2;

        int num = 1, countIndex = 2, oneCounter = 1;
        int index = 3;
        while (index < n) {
            int numCount = magicalString[countIndex];
            while (numCount-- > 0 && index < n) {
                magicalString[index ++] = num;
                if (num == 1) ++ oneCounter;
            }

            ++ countIndex;
            num ^= 3; // swtich between 1 and 2
        }

        return oneCounter;
    }
}
```
