You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.
For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

```
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
```

If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].

# Solution

The idea is quite straightforward: just traverse s and each time when we see two consecutive+s, convert them to -s and add the resulting string to the final result moves. But remember to recover the string after that.

```java
class Solution {

    public List<String> generatePossibleNextMoves(String s) {
        List<String> reval = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            if(s.charAt(i) == '+' && s.charAt(i-1) == '+'){
                reval.add(s.substring(0, i-1) + "--" + s.substring(i+1));
            }
        }
        return reval;
    }
}
```
