Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

For example,
```
Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],
return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].
```

# Solution

The straightforward solution is having an empty array list, and then begin to add interval one by one into the list. When adding each interval, we compare it with all the existing interval to see whether it can be merged with any. Obviously, the time complexity is O(n^2).

How can we improve it? We know the intervals are disordered, to put it another way it doesn't have a "pattern". What if we make them as ordered, thus give them a "pattern"? We know that a good sorting algorithm has O(nlogn) time complexity.

The idea is to sort the intervals by their starting points. Then, we take the first interval and compare its end with the next intervals starts. As long as they overlap, we update the end to be the max end of the overlapping intervals. Once we find a non overlapping interval, we can add the previous “extended” interval and start over.

Sorting takes ```O(n log(n))``` and merging the intervals takes ```O(n)```. So, the resulting algorithm takes ```O(n log(n))```.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.length <= 1) return intervals;

        // Sort by ascending starting point
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (i1, i2) -> Integer.compare(i1[0], i2[0]));

        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int[] interval : intervals){
            if (result.isEmpty() || result.get(result.size() - 1)[1] < interval[0]) {
                result.add(interval);
            } else {
                result.get(result.size() - 1)[1] = Math.max(result.get(result.size() - 1)[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }

        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }
}
```
